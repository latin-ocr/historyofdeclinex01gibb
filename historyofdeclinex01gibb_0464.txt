THE DECLINE AND FALL

The conduct which the emperor Probus had adopted in the dis-
posal of the vanquished, was imitated by Diocletian and his affo-
ciates. The captive barbarians, exchanging death for ssavery, were
distributed among the provincials, and affigned to those distriets
(in Gaul, the territories of Amiens‚ Beauvais‚ Cambray, Treves,
Lang'res, and Troyes‚ are particularly specified ³⁷) which had been
depopulated by the calamities of war. They were usefully em-
ployed as shepherds and husbandmen, but were denied the exercise of
arms, except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the
military service. Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands,
with a less servile tenure, to such of the barbarians as solicited
the prote&ion of Rome. They granted a settlement to several
colonies of the Carpi, the Bastarnae, and the Sarmatians; and, by a
dangerous indulgence, permitted them in some measure to retain
their ·national manners and independence³³. Among the pro·
vincials‚ it was a subjed‘r of flattering exultation, that the barbarian,
so lately an objest of terror, now cultivated their lands, drove their
cattle to the neighbouring fair, and contributed by his labour to the
public plenty. They congratulated their masters on the powerful
acceffion of subjec‘3oe and soldiers; but they forgot to observe, that
multitudes of'secret enemies‚ insolent from favour, or desperate
from oppreffion, were introduced into the heart of the empire ³⁹.

While the Caesars exereised their valour on the banks of the Rhine
and Danube, the presence of the emperors was required on the

southern confines of the Roman world. From the Nile to Mount
Atlas, Africa was in arms. A ‚confederacy of five Moerii‘h nations
