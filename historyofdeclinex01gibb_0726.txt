as he sat on his tribunal, it may be presumed that every mode of
tortum, which cruelty could invent or constancy could endure, was
exhausted on those devoted victims ¹⁷⁹. Two circumstances, how-
ever, have been unwarily mentioned, which insinuate that the ge-
neral treatment of the Christians who had been apprehended by the
officers of justic⁴e was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to
have been. 1. The confessors who were condemned to work in the
mines, were permitted, by the humanity or the negligence of their
keepers, to build chapels, and freely to profess their religion in the
midst of those d1·earyhabitations¹⁸⁰. 2. The bilhops were obliged
to check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians, who vo-
luntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates. Some of
these were persons oppreffed by poverty and debts‚ who blindly fought
to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death. Others were
allured by the hope, that a short confinement would expiate the fins
of a whole life3 and others again were aetuated by the less honour-
able motive of deriving a plentiful subfistenoe, and perhaps a confi-
derable profit, from the alms which the charity of the faithful be-
stowed on the prisoners ¹⁸¹. After the church had triumphed over all
her enemies‚ the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted
them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A conve-
