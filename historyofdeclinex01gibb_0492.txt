first example of a resignati0n ¹⁰⁶, which has not been very ‘fre-

virtues were much less the effe& of nature than of art. The 'abdi-

of fortune3 and the disappointment of his favourite schemes urged
him to relinquilh a power which he found inadequate to his arn-

terrupted success3 nor was it till after he had vanquished all his
enemies, and accompliffied all his deligns, that he seems to have
