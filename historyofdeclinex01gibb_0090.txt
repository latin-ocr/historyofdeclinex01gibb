issand of Sicily, and most probably in the adjacent eontinent; but
it was not improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful
to the taste, of the savage inhabitants ⁹4. A thousand years af-
terwards, Italy could boast, that of the fourscore most generous
and celebrated wines‚ more than two-thirds were produced from

nese province of Gau13 but so intense was the cohl to the north of
the Cevennes, that, in the time of Strabo, it was thought impoffible
to ripen the grapes in those parts of Gaul ⁹⁶. This difficulty,
however, was gradually vanquished3 and there is some reason to
