OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the science of tadlics was cultivated with success ; and as long as the
empire retained any vigour‚ their military instructions were respect-
ed, as the most perfect model of Roman discipline.

Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the service
many alterations and improvements. The legions, as they are de-
scribed by Polybius 4¹, in the time of the Punic wars, differed very

⁸ materially from those which archieved the victories of Caeszxr, or de—

fended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines. The consti-
tution of the Imperial legion may be describedin a few words ⁴². The
heavy-armed infantry, which composed its principal strength ⁴³, was
divided into ten cohorts, and fifty-five companies, under the orders
of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions. The first
cohort, which always claimed the post of honour and the custody of
the eagle, was formed of eleven hundred and five soldier& the most
approved for valour and fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts con-
sisted each of five hundred and fifty—five3 andr the whole body of
legionary infantry amounted to fix thousand one hundred men.
Their arms vvere uniform, and admirably adapted to the nature of
their service : an open helmet, with a lofty crest; a breast-plate‚ or
coat of mail·‚ greaves on their legs, and an ample buckler on their
left arm. The buekler was 01c an oblong and concave figure, four feet
in length, and two and a half in breadth, framed of a light woed,

covered with a bull's hide, and strongly guarded with plates of
brasS. Resides a lighter spem, the legionary soldier grasped in his

right hand the formidahlepilum, a ponderous javclin, whose utmost
length was about six feet, and which was terminated by a maisy
