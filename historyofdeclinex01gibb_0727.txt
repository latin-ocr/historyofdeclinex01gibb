OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

martyrs, whose wounds had been instantly healed‚ whose strength had
been renewed, and whose lost member-*S had miraculoussy been re-
stored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every
difficulty, and of sileneing every objection. The most extravagant
legends, as they conduced to the 'honour of the church, were ap-
plauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power
of the cler-gy, and attested by the suspicions evidence of ecclefiastieal
history. ,

The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and
torture‚ are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an
artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fa&
ofa more distinet and stubborn kind3 the number of persons who
suffered death in consequence of the ediets published by Diocletian,
his affociates‚ and his succeffors. The recent legendaries record
whole armies and cities, which were at once swept away by the un·
distinguishing rage of persecution. The more antient writers content
themselves with pouring out a liberal effufion of loose and tragieal in-
vetffives, without condescending to ascertain the precise number of
those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief
of the gospel. From the history of Eusebius, it may however be col-
lei‘ted, that only nine bishops were punished with death3 and we are
affured, by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine,
that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to that ho-
nourable appellation¹⁸². As we are unaequainted with the degree
