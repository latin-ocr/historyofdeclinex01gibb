found thought, and intense applicati0n3 but by mistaking the true C {41ssss P.
object of philosophy, their labours contributed much less to improve k—-v—d,
than to corrupt the human understanding. The knowledge that is
suited to our fituation and powers, the whole compass of moral, na-
tural, and mathematieal science, was neglected by the new Plato-
nists; whilst they exhausted their strengthrin the verbal disputes of
metaphyfics‚ attempted to explore the secrets of the invifible world,
and studied to reconcile Arist'otle with Plato, on subjects of which
both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind.
Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditatione,
their minds were exposed to illufions of fancy. They flattered them-
selves that they poffeffed the secret of disengaging the soul from its
corporeal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with daemons and
spirits, and, by a very fingular revolution, converted the study of phi-
losophy into that of magic- The ancient fages had derided the po-
pular superstition; after disguismg its extravagance by the thin pre-
tence of allegory, the disciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its
most zealous defendet-s. As they agreed with the Christians in a few
mysterious points of saith, they attacked the remainder of their theo-
logical system with all the fury of civil war. The new Platonists
would scarcely deserve a place in the history of seleuce, but in that of
the church the mention of them will very frequently occur.

the most complete idea of the genius of the very curious piece is inserted in Fabricius,
seit, and the manners ofits professbrs. Thiss Bibliotheca Graeca, tom. iv. p. 83-143.
