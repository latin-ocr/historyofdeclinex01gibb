Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even the good sense of The senate

the emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected reve-
rence for the senate, and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil
policy instituted by Augustus. But the youth of Severus had been
trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and his riper years spent
in the despotism of military command. His haughty and inflexible
spirit could not discover, or would not acknowledge, the advantage
of preserving an intermediate power, however imaginary, between
the emperor and the army. He ,disdained to profess himself the
servant of -an ass'embly that detested his person and trembled at

a conqueror, and exercised, without disguise, the whole legissative
as well as the executive power.

The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye

and every paffion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who pos· ,4

seffed the arms and treasure of the state; whilst the senate, neither
elected by the people‚ nor guarded by military force, nor ani-
mated by public spirit, rested its declining authority on the frailssand
crumbling basis of ancient opinion. The fine theory of a repub-
lic insensibly vanissied, and made way for the more natural and sub-
stantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom and honours of Rome
were succeffively communicated to the provinces, in which the old
government had been either unknown, or was remcmbered with
abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obli-
terated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines ⁷⁰ ol)-
serve, witha malicious pleasure, that although the sovereign of Rome,
in compliance with an oblolete prejudice, abstainetl from the name
