OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

fubfisted‚ as an independent state, from the time ofthe Peloponnefian
war ⁹⁸, was at last swallowed up by the ambition of Mithridates ⁵⁹,
and with the rest of his dominions, sunk under the weight of
the Roman arms. From the reign of Augustus ¹⁰⁰, the kings of
Bosphorus were the humble, but not useless, allies of the ern-
pire. By presents, by artnS, and by a ssight fortification drawn
across the Isthmus, they effe&ually guarded against the roving
plunderers of Sarmatia, the access of a country, which, from its
peculiar fituation and convenient harbours, commanded the Euxine
sea and Asia Minor ¹⁰¹. As long as the sceptre was poffeffed by a
lineal succeffion of kings‚ they acquitted themselves of their import-
ant charge with vigilance and success. Domestic faffions, and the
fears, or private interest, of obscure usurpers, who seized on the
vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the heart of Bosphorus.
With the acquisltion of a superfluous waste of fertile soil, the con-
querors obtained the command of a naval force, sufficient to trans-
port their armies to the coast of Afia ¹⁰². The ships used in the
navigation of the Euxine were of a very singular construction.
They were ssight flat—bottomed barks framed of timber only, with-

shelving roof, on the appearance of a tempest ¹⁰³. ln these floating
houses, the Goths carelessly trusted themselves to the mercy of an
unknown sea, under the condit& of failors preffed into the service,
and whose {kill and fidelity were equally suspicions. But the hopes
of plunder had banished every idea of danger, and a natural sear-
leffness of temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence,
