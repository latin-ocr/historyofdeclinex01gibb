Imperial pre-
rogatives.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

ministred by several important restrictions. Their authority expired
with the year in which they were eleeted ; the former office was di-
vided between two, the latter among ten persons; and, as both in
their private and public interest they were averse to each other, their
mutual conflicts contributed, for the most part, to strengthen rather
than to destroy the balance of the constitution. But when the con-
sular and tribunitian powers were united, when they were vested
for life in a fingle person, when the general of the army was, at the
same time, the minister of the senate and the representative of the
Roman people‚ it was impoflible to reslst the cxercise, nor was it.easy
to define the limits, of his imperial prerogative.

To these accumulated honours, the policy of Augustus soon added
the splendid as well as important dignities of supreme pontiffi and
of censor. By the former he acquired the management of the
religion, and by the latter a legal inspeetion over the manners and
fortunes‚ of the Roman people. If so many distinct and independ-
ent powers did not exaCtly unite with each other, the complaisance
of the senate Was prepared to supply every deficiency by the most
ample and extraordinary conceffions. The emperors, as the first
ministers of the republic, were exempted from the obligation and
penalty of many inconvenient laws x they were authorized to con-
voke the senate, to make several motions in the same day, to recom-
mend candidates for the honours of the state, to enlarge the bounds
of the city, to employ the revenue at their discretiori, to declare
peace and war, to ratify treaties; and by a most comprehenfive
clause, they were empowered to execute whatsoever they should
judge advantageous to the empire, and agreeable to the majessy of
things private or public, human or divine ¹⁴.
