genuine miracles should have insti-ueted t‘h'e Christian world in the
ways of providence, and habituated their eye (if we may use a
very inadequate expression} to the style of the divine artist. Should
the most skilful pxiinter of modern Italy presume to decorate his

solent fraud would be soon discovered and indignantly rejected.
Whatever opinion may be entertained of the miracles of the
primitive chureh smee the time of the apostles, this unrefisting soft—
ness of temper, so conspicuous among the believers of the second
and third centur-ies, proved of some accidental benefit to the cause of
truth and religion. In modern times, a latent and even involuntary
scepticism adheres to the most pious dispofitions. Their admiffion
of supernatural truths is much less an adive consent than a cold
and paffive acquiescence. Accustomed long since to observe and to
respect the invariable order of Nature, our reason, or at least our
imagination, is not sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible aetion
of the Deity. But in the first ages of Christianity‚ the fittlation'of
mankind was extremely different. The most curious, or the most
credulem, among the Pagans, were often persuaded to enter into a
society, which afferted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The
primitive Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their
minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraor-
dinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every s1de they
