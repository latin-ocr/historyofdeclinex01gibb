people who had so lately admired the trophies of Aurelian, gazed
with equal pleasurc on those of his heroic succeffor ⁵⁵. We cannot,
on this OccaslOn, forget the desperate courage of about fourscore
Gladiators‚ reserved with near fix hundred others, for the inhuman
sports of the amphitheatro. Disdaining to ssied their blood for the
amusement of the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from
the place of their confinement, and filled the streets of Rome with
blood and confufion. After an obstinate resistance they were over-
powered and cut in pieces by the regular forces3 but they obtained
at least an honourable death, and the satisfaction of a just re-
venge ⁵⁶.

The military discipline which reigned in the camps of Probus,
was less cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and
exact. The latter had puniihed the irregularities of the soldiers with
unrelenting severity, the former prevented them by employing the
legions in constant and useful labours. XVhen Probus commanded
in Egypt, he executed many considerable works for the splendour
and benefit of that rich country. The navigation of the Nile, so
important to Rome itself, was improved3 and temples, bridgeS,
poi-times, and palace8‚ were construffited by the hands of the
soldiers‚ who acted by turns as archstedss, as engineers, and as
husbandmen ⁵⁷. It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to pre-

had obliged them to form large plantatione of olive trees' along the
coast of Africa⁵⁸. From a similar principle, Probus exercised his
legions in covering, with rich vineyards, the hills of Gaul and
