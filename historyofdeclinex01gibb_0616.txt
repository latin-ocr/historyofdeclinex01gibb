THE DECLINE AND FALL

vinces were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and associa-
tion (such was their very accurate expreffion) in the Christian aris-
tocracy¹²⁴. But the power of a monarch was rejected with ab·
horr-enee, and the aspiring genius of Rome experienced from the
nations of Alia and Africa, a more vigorous refistance to her spiri-
tual, than 'she had formerly done to her temporal‚ dominion. The
patriotie Cypriam, who ruled with the most absolute sway the chureh
of Carthage and the provincial synods, opposed vvith resolution and
success the azubition of the Roman pontiffi artfully conne&ed his
own cause with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal,
fought out new allies in the heart of Afia¹²⁵. If this Punic war
was carried on without any effulion of blood, it was owing much
less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending pre-
lates. Investives and excommunications were their only weapons;
and xthese, during the progress of the whole controversy, they
hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion. The hard
necessity of censuring either a pope, or a saint and martyr, distreffes
the modern catholies whenever they are obliged to relate the par-
ticulars of a dispute‚ in which the champions of religion indulged
such pallions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the
camp'²⁶.

The progress of theecclefiastical authority gave birth to the me·-
morable distinerion of the laity and of the clergy, which had been
unknown to the Greeks and Romans¹²⁷. The former of these
appellations comprehend the body of the Christian people3 the
