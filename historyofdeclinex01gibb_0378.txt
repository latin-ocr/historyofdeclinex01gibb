THE DECLINE AND FALL

companied by their farnilies. 111. The loss of their ficet, which was
either taken or sunk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A vast
circle of Roman posts distributed with ss<i11‚ supported with firmness,
and gradually closrng towards a common contre, forced the barbarians
into the most inacceffible parts of mount Haemus, where they found
a safe refuge, but a very scanty subfistence. During the course of a
rigorous winter, iu which they were befieged by the emperor's
troops, famine and pestilence‚ desertion and the sword, continually
diminished the imprisoned multitude. On the return of spring,
nothing appeared iu arms except a hardy and desperate band, the
remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the mouth of
the Niester.

The pestilence which swept away such numbers of the barbarians,
at length proved fatal to their conqueror. After a short but glo-
rious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidst the
tears and acclamations of his subjects. In his last illness, he con-
vened the principal Officers of the state and army, and in their pre-
sence recommended Aurelia-n, one of his generals, as the most de-
scrving of the throne, and the best qualified to execute the great
design which he himself had been permitted only to undertake. The
virtues of Claudius, his valour, affability ¹⁴, justice, and tempe-
rance, his love of fame and of his country, place him in that short
list of emperors who added lustre to the Roman purple. Those vir-
tues, however, were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency
by the courtly writers of the age of Constantine, who was the great

grandson of Crispus, the elder brother of Claudius. The voice of
flattery was soon taught to repeat, that the gods, who so hastily had
snatched Claudius from the earth, rewarded his merit and piety by
the perpetual establissrment of the empire in his family ¹⁵.
