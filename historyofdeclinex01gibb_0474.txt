His viftory.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

he returned to Antioch, Diocletian received him, not with the ten-
derness of a friend and colleague‚ but with the indignation 'of an
offended sovereign. The haughtiest of men, clothed in his purple,
but humbled by the sense of his fault and misfortune, was obliged
to follow the emperor’s chariot above a mile on foot‚ and to exhibit,
before the whole court, the spe-&acle of his disgrace ⁶³.

As soon as Diocletian had indulged his private resentment‚ and
asserted the majesty of supreme power, he yielded to the submiflive
entreaties of the Caesar, and permitted him to retrieve his own honour
as well as that -of the Roman arms. In the room of the unwarlike
troops of Asia, which had most probably served in the first expe-
dition, a second army was drawn from the veteratis and new levies

vof the Illyrian frontier, and a considerable body of Gothic auxili-

aries were taken into the Imperial pay ⁶⁹. At the head of a chosen
army of twenty-five thousand men, Gallerius again passed the Eu—
phrate33 but, instead of exposing his legions in the open plains of
Mesopotamia, he advanced through the mountains of Armenia,
where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause, and the country
as favourable to the operations of infantry, as it was inconvenient
for the motions of cavalry ⁷⁰. Adversity had confirmed the Ro-
man discipline, while the barbarians, elated by success, were become
so negligent and remisS, that in the moment when they least ex·-
pet‘ssled it, they were surprised by the affilive conclu& of Galerius,
who, attended only by two horscmen, had with his own eyes secretly
examined the state and position of their camp. A surprise, especially
in the night-time, was for the most part fatal to a Persian army.
