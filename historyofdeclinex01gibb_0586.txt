THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 1345* P. cover, that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is omitted
μηζ..) in the law of Mose53 it is darkly infinuated by the prophets, and

during the long period which elapsed between the Egyptian and the
Babylonian servitudes‚ the ‘hopes ais well as fears of the Jews
appear to have been confined within the narrow compass of the
present life⁵⁸. After Cyrus had permitted the exiled nation to
return into the promised land, and after Ezra had restored the
ancient records of their religion, two celebrated seecs, the Saducees
and the Pharisees, insensibly arose at Jerusalem ⁵⁹. The former
selected from the more opulent and distinguished ranks of society,
were striffly attached to the literal sense of the Mosaic law, and
they pioussy rejected the immortality of the soul, as an opinion that
received no countenanee from the divine book, which they revered

as the only rule of their faith. To' the authority of scripture the
Pharisees added that of tradition, and they accepted, under the
name of traditions‚ several speculative tenets from the philosophy
or religion of the eastern nations. The doctrines of fate or pre-
destination, of angels and spirits, and of a future state of rewards
and punishments, were in the number of these new articles of
belief; and as the Pharisees, by the austerity of their manners, had
drawn into their party the body of the Jewish people‚ the immor-
tality of the soul became the prevailing sentiment of the synagogue,
under the reign of the Asmonaean princes and pontiffs. The tem·
-per of the Jews was incapable of eontenting itself with such a cold
and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of a Polytheist3 and as

soon as they admitted the idea of a future state, they embraced it

Ecclesmst. e. 1. secl. 8.). His authority seems
to carry the greater weight‚ as he has written
a learned and judicious commentary on the
books of the Old Testament.

admitted only the Pentateuch; but it has
pleased some modern critics to add the pro-
phets to their creed, and to suppose, that
they contented themselves with rejecting the
traditions of the Pharisees. Dr. Jortin has
argued that point in his Remarks on Ecclesi-
astical History‚ vol. ii. p. ¹03·
