to continue the operations of the fiege, whilst, at the head of ss-v-J

’ those troops on whose valour and fidelity he more particularly de-
pended‚ he advanced in person to engage the general of Maxen-
tius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according to
the usual praefice of war5 but their experienced leader, perceiving
that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own, suddenly
changed his disposition, and reducing the second, extended the front
of his first, line to a just proportion with that of the enemy. Such
evolutions, which only veteran troops can execute without con-
fusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove decifive: but as
this engagement began towards the close of the day, and was con-
tested with great obstinacy during the whole night, there was less
room for the conduct of the generals than for the courage of the sol-
diers. The return of light displayed the victory of Constantine,
and a field of carnage covered with many *thousands of the van-
quilhed Italians. Their general Pompeianus was found among the
ssain3 Verona immediately surrendered al discretion, and the gar-
rison was made prisoners of war ⁵⁸. When the officers of the vic·
torious army congratulated their master on this important success,
they ventured to add some respetstful complaints, of such a nature,
however, as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without dis-
pleasure. They represented to Constantine, that, not contented
with performing all the duties of a commander, he had exposed his
own person with an excess of valour which almost degenerated into
rashness; and they conjured him for the future to* pay more regard
to the preservation of a life, in which the safcty of Rome and of
the empire was involved ⁵⁹.
