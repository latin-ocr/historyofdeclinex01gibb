ss the birth or the death of Christ, had obstinately persisted in the
worship of the decimos, neither deserved nor could expe& a pardon
from the irritated justice of the Deity. These rigid sentiments,
which had been unknown to the ancient world, appear to have in-

“ hot flames with their deluded Tcholars; so many celebrated poets
“ trembling before the tribunal, not of Minos, but of Christ3 so
“ many tragediam, more tuneful in the expreffion of their own

will permit me to draw a veil over the rest of this infernal descrip-
tion, which the zealous African pursues in a long variety of affected
and unfeeling witticisms ⁷².
