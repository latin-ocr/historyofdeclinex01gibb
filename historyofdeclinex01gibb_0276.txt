-THE DECLINE AND FALL

Seleucia, on the western bank of the Tigris, about forty·five
miles to the north of ancient Babylon, was the capital of the Mace-
donian conquests in Upper Afia ³³. Many ages after the fall of their
empne, Seleucia retained the genuine characters of a Grecian colony,
ans, military virtue, and the love of freedom. The independent
republic was governed by a senate of three hundred nobles3 the
people consisted of fix hundred thousand citizens3 the walls were
strong, and as long as concord prevailed among the several orders of
the state, they viewed‘ with contempt the power of the Parthian : but
the madness of faction was sometimes provoked to implore the dan-
gerous aid of the common enemy, who was posted almost at the gates
of the eolony³⁹· The Parthian monarche, like the Mogul sovereigns
of Hindostan‚ delighted in the pastoral life of their Scythian ances-
tors; and the Imperial camp was frequently pitched in the plain of
Ctesiphon, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, at the distance of only
three miles from Seleucia 4⁰. The innumerable attendants on luxury
and despotism resorted to the court, and the little village of Ctefi·
phon insenfibly swelled into a great city 4¹. Under the reign of
Marcus, the Roman generals penetrated as far as Ctesiphon and Se·
leucia. They were received as friends by the Greek colony; they
attacked as· enemies the seat of the Parthian kings ς yet both cities
experienced the same treatment. The sack and conflagration of·
