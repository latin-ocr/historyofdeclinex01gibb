OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 69

It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries should C HILA Ρ·

discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and cor- {Tr—⁴
ruption. This long peace, and the uniform government of the ςοῐςῑζέἓῖἷ
Romans, introduced a ssow and secret poison into the vitals of the

empire. The ‘minds of men were gradually reduced to the same
level,'the sire of genius was extinguished, and even the military

spirit evaporated. The natives of Europe were brave and robust-

Spain‚ Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum supplied the legions with ex-

cellent soldiers, and constituted the real strength of the monarchy.

Their personal valour remained‚ but they no longer possessed that

public courage which is nourissied by the love of independence, the

sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of
command. They received laws and governors from the will of

their sovereign‚ and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.

The posterity of their boldest leaders was contented with the rank

of citizens and subjeets. The most aspiring spirits resorted to the

court or standard of the emperors; and the deserted provinces, de-

prived of political strength or union, insensibly sunk into the languid
indifference of private life.

The love of letters, almost inseparable from peace and re· ofgenius,
fincment, was fashionable among the subjects of Hadrian and
the Antonines‚ who were themselves men of learning and cu-
riosity. It was diffused over the whole extent of their em-

rhetoric: Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and ssudied on
the banks of the Rhine and Danube3 and the most liberal rewards
fought out the faintest glimmerings of literary merit¹¹⁰. The
