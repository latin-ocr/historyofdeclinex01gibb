468 THE DECLINE AND FALL

delay, to the favourite retirement which he had chosen in his
native country of Dalmatia. On the same day, which was the
first of May¹⁰⁹‚ Maximian, as it had been previoussy concerted‚
made his resignation of the Imperial dignity at Milan. Even
in the splendour of the Roman triumph, Diocletian had medi-
tated his design of abdicating the government. As he wished
to secure the obedience of Maximino, he exacted from him
either a general affurance that he would submit his actions to the
authority of his benefaeton or a particular promise that he would
descend from the throne, whenever he should receive the advice

and the example. This engagement, though it was confirmed
by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline
Jupiter '‘0, would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce tem-
per of Maximian, whose passion was the love of power, and who
neither defired present tranquillity nor future reputation. But
he yielded, however remitantly, to the ascendant which his
wiser colleague had acquired over him, and retired‚ immediately
after his abdication‚ to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost im-

possible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tran-
quillity.
