oF THE ΒΟΜᾸΝ EMPIRE.

In the second chapter of this work we have attempted to explain
in what manner the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asta,
and Africa, were united under the dominion of one sovereign,
and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of man-
ners, and of language. The Jews of Palestine, who had fondly
expected a tempora1.deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the mi-
racles of the divine prophet, that it was found unneceffary to
publish, or at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel ¹⁵². The au-
thentic histories of the actions of Christ were composed in the
Greek language, at a considerable distance from Jerusalem, and
after the Gentile converte were grown extremely numerous ¹⁵³.
As soon as those histories were transsated into the Latin tongue,
they were perfeffly intelligible to all the subjeets of Rome, excepting
only to the peasants of Syria and Egypt, for whose benefit par-
ticular verfions were afterwards made⁴ The public highways,
which had been construet-ed for the use of the legions, opened an
easy passage for the Christian miffionaries from Damascus to Corinth,
and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or Britain 3 nor did those
. spiritual conquerors encounter any of the obstacles which usually
retard or prevent the introdud'tion of a foreign religion into a
distant country. There is the strongest reason to believe, that bc-
fore the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine, the saith of Christ
had been preached in every province, and in all the great cities of
