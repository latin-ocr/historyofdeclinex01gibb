OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.⁴

purity of their saith, already offered a very lively image of the
primitive discipline¹⁶². It was in the school of Alexandria that the
Christian theology appears to have affumed a regular and scientifical
form37 and when Hadrian visited Egypt, he found a church com-
posed of Jews and of Greeks, sufficiently important to attra& the no·
tice of that inquifitive prince¹‘⁶³. But the progress of Christianity
was for a long time confined within the limits ofa single city, which
was· itself a· foreign colony, and till the close of the second century,
the predeceffors of Demetrius were the on-ly prelates of the Egyptian
church. Three bilhops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius,
and the number wasincreased to twenty by his successor Hera-
clas ¹⁶4. The body of the nafives, a people distinguissied by a sullen

¹⁶⁵, entertained the new doen-ine with cold-

inflexibility of temper
ness' and reluctance: and even in the time of Origen‚ it was rare
to meet withan Egyptian who had surmounted his early prejudices

in favour of the sacred animals of his country ¹⁶⁶. As soon, indeed,

as Christianity ascended the “throne, the zeal of those barbarians‘
obeyed the prevailing impulfion3 the cities of Egypt were filled with

bishops, and the deserts of Thebais swarmed with hermits.
A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials fiowed into the
capacious bosom of Rome. Whatever was strange or odious, who-v

ever was guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that

immense capital, to elude the vigilance of the law.

¹⁶² Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. 2. c. 20,
21, 22, 23. has examined with the most cri-
tical accuracy‚ the curious treatise of Philo,
which describes the Therapeutae. By prov-
ing that it was composed as early as the time
of Augustus, Basnage has demonstrated, in
spite of Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17.), and a crowd
of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutae
were neither Christians nor monks. It still
remains probable that they changed their
name, preserved their manners, adopted some
new articles of saith, and gradually became
the fathers of the Egyptian Asteries.
