OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the Caristian pontifis, who, deriving their claim of universal do·-
minion'Yrom an humble fisherman of Galilee, have succeeded to the
throne of the Caesars, given laws to the barbarian conquerors of
Rome, and extended their spiritual ju1·isdi‹5tion from the coast of the
Baltic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.

But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero's per-
secution, till we have made some observations‚ that may serve to
remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed, and to throw
forne light on the subsequent history of the church.

1. The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth of
this extraordinary fact, and the integrity of this celebrated passage
of Tacitus. The former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate
Suetonius, who mentions the punishment which Nero inflifted on
the Christians, a sect of men who had embraced *a new and criminal
superstition³⁵. The latter may be proved by the consent of the
most ancient manuscripts; by the inimitable character of the style of
Tacitus ;⁴ by his reputation, which guarded his text from the inter-
polations of pious fraud, and by the purport of his narratim, which
accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes, without in-
finuating that they poffeffed any miraculous or even magical powers-
above the rest of mankind ³⁶. 2. Notwithstanding it is probable that
Tacitus was born some years before the fire of Rome ³⁷, he could de-

If any doubt can still remain concerning this⁴
celebrated passage, the render may examine

of malefica, which some sagacious comment-

ators have transsated magical, is considered
by the more rational Mosheim as only syno-
nymous to the exitiabilis of Tacitus.

'2⁶ The pass‘age concerning Jesus Christ,
which was inserted into the text of Joscphus,
between the time of Origen and that of Euse-
bins, may furnish an example of no vulgar
forgery. The accromplithment of the pro-
phecies, the virtues, miracles, and resurrec-
tion of Jesus, are distinffly related. josephus
acknowledges that he was the Messiah, and
‚hcfitates whether he should call him a man.
