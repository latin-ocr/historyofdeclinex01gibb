a period, when saith could boast of so many wonderful victories
over death, it seems difficult to account for the scepticisrn of those

the whole controversy, and promised Theophilus, bishop of Antioch,
that if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who
had been actually raised from the dead, he would immediately em-

prelate of the first eastern chureii, however anxious for the con-
version of his friend, thought proper to decline this fair and reason·

torian does not call upon him to interpose his private judgment in
this nice and important controversy3 but he ought not to diffemble
the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interest
