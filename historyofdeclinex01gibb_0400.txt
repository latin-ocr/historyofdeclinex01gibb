THE DECLINE AND FALL

followed the executionem pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestow-
ing comfort on his afflicted friends ⁷⁴.

Returning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already
croffed the Streights which divide Europe from Asta, when he was
provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had maffacred
the governor and gari-ison which he had left among them, and again
ereered the standard of revolt. without a moment's deliberation,
he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed

by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the irre-
sistible weight of his resenttnent. We have a letter of Aurelian
himself, in which hc acknowledges ⁷⁵, that old men, women, chil-
dren, and peasants‚ had been involved in that dreadful execution,
which should have been confined to armed· rebellion ; and although
his principal concern seems dirested to the re-establissrment of a tem-
ple of the Sun, he discovers some pity for the remnant of the Palmy-
reniam, to whom he grants the permiffion of rebuilding and inha-
biting their city. But it is eafier to destroy than to restore. The
seat of commerce, of arts, and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an
obscure town, a trifling fortress, and at length a miserable village.
The present citizens of Palmyra, consisting of thirty or fflrty fami-
lies, have erected their mud cottages within the spacious court of a
magnificent temple.

Another and a last labour still awaited the indefatigable Aureliam

reve i0·n to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, Wh0‚ during the re'-

volt of Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the Nile. Firmus,
the friend and ally‚ as he proudly styled himself, of Odenathus and
Zenobia, was no more than a wcalthy merchant of Egypt. In the

course of his trade to India, he had formed very intimate connexioms
with the Saraccns and the Blemmyes, whose situation on either coast

of the Red Sea gave them an easy introduffion into the Upper
