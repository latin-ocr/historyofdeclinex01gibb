OF Tne RoMAN EMPIRE. ιρι

“ In the presence of your sovereign and benefa&0r, who bestows C PM} P.

fury of the legion, and their brandished arins already threatened his
person. “ Your courage,” resumed the intrepid Alexander, ‘⁴ would

perfisted in clamorous sedition, when the emperor pronounced, with
a loud voice, the decifive sentence, “ Citizens Ι l'ay down your arms,
“ and departiri peace to your respective habitations.’' The tempest
was instanti-y appeased; the soldiers, filled with grief and ssiame,
filently confeffed the justice of their punishment and the power of
discipline, yielded up their arms and military enfigns, and retired
in confufion, not to their camp, but to the several inns of the city..
Alexander enjoyed, during thirty days, the edifying speciade of
their repentance3 nor did he restore them to their former rank in
the army, till he had punished with death those tribunes whose con-
nivance had occasioned the mutiny. The grateful legion served the
emperor, whilst living„ and revenged him when dead ⁷⁸.
