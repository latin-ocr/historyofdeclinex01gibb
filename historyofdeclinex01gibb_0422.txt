396 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C §nst-³ P. read by the consul, the senators were unable to disguise their satis-

ι-ψ-ι ἷειᾶὶίοη, that Probus ssiould condescend thus humbly to solicit a

sceptre which he already possess'ed. They celebrated with the
warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above all his mode-
ration. A decree immediately paffed, without a diffenting voice, to
ratify the elestion of the eastern armies, and to confer on their
chief all the several branches of the Imperial dignity : the names of
Caesar and Augustus, the title of Father of his country, the right
of making in the same day three motions in the senate ²⁷, the office
of Pontifex Maximus, the tribunitiam power, and the proconsular
command3 a mode of investiture, which, though it seemed to mul-
tiply the authority of the emperor, expreffed the constitution of the
ancient republic. The reign of Probus corresponded with this fair
beginning. The senate was permitted to dire& the civil admini-
stration of the empire. Their faithful general afferted the honour
of the Roman arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold
and barbaric tmphies, the fruits of his numerous vidtmies ²³. Yet,
whilst he gratified their vanity, he must secretly have despised their
indolence and weakness. Though it was every moment in their
power to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud sucees-
sors of the Scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclufion from all
military employmentS. They soon experienced, that those who re-
fuse the sword, must renounce the sceptre.
