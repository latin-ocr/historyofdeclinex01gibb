of government⁴ The anibition of the Romans was consined to the
land; nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the enter·
prising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre, of Car-
thage, and even of Marseilles, to enlarge the bounds of the world,
and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean. To the Romans
tlie ocean remained an object of terror rather thari of curiosity ⁶⁶5
the whole extent of the Mediterraneum, after the destruetion of Car-
tliage, and the extirpation of the pirates, was included within their
provinces. The policy of the emperors was directed only to pre-
serve the peaceful dominion of that sea, and to prote& the coni-
merce of their subjects. With these moderate views, Augustus
stationed two permanent fleets in the most convenient ports of
Italy, the one at Ravenna, on the Adriatic, the other at Misenum,
in the bay of Naples. Experience seems at length to have con-
vinced tlie ancients, that as soon as their gallies exeeeded two, or
at the most three ranks of oars, they were suited rather for vain
pomp than for real service. Augustus himself, in the vid‘tory of
Actium, had seen the superiority of his own light frigates (they
were called Liburnians) over the lofty but unvvieldy castles of his
rival ⁶⁷. Of these Liburnians he composed the two fleets of Ra-
venna and Misenum, destined to command, the one the eastern,
the other the western division of the Mediterranean; and to each
of the squadrons he attached a body of several thousand marines.
