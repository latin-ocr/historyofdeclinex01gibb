OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation of Constantius was
for-a while deferred; and as soon as a father’e death had released
Carinus from the control of fear or deeency, he displayed to the
Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty
of Domitian ⁸².

The only merit of the administration of Carinus that history
could record or poetry celebrate, was the uneommon splendour with·
which, in his own and his brother’s name, he exhibited the Roman
games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre. More than
twenty years afterwards, when the courtiers of Diocletian repre-
sented to their frugal sovereign the fame and popularity of his mu-
nificent predecessor, he acknowledged, that the reign of Carinus
had indeed been a reign of pleasure ⁸³. But this vain prodigality,
which the prudence of Diocletian might justly despise, was enjoyed

with surprise and transport by the Roman people. The oldest of

the citizens, recollesting the speetacles of former days, the triumph-
al pomp of Probus or Aurelian, and the secular games of the em-
peror Philip, acknowledged that they were all surpaffed by the supe-
rior magnificence of Carinus ⁸⁴.

The speoaeles of Carinus may therefore be best illustrated by the
observation of some particulars, which history has condescended to
relate concerning those of his predeceffors. If we confine ourselves
solely to the hunting of wild beasts‚ however we may censure the
vanity of the defign or the cruelty of the execution, we are obliged
to confess, that neither before nor since the time of the Romans,
so much art and expence have ever been lavished for the amuse-
