They affirmed, that if the Being, who is the same through all
eternity‚ had designed to abolilh those sacred rites which had lerved
to distinguiss1 his chosen people, the repeal of them would have
been no less clear and solemn than their first promulgatiOn: that,
instead of those frequent declarations, which either suppose or affert
the perpetuity of the Mosaic religion, it would have been re-
presented as a provifionary scheme intended to last only till 'the
coming of the Meffiah, who should instrue} mankind in a more
perse& mode of faith and of worship¹⁵z that the Meffiah him-
self, and his disciples who conversed with him on earth, instead of
authorizing by their example the most minute observances of the
Mosaic law¹⁶‚ would have published to the world the abolition of
those useless and obsolete ceremonies, without suffering Christianity
to remain during so many years obscurely confounded among the
seets of the Jewish church. Arguments like these appear to have
been used in the defence of the expiring cause of the Mosaic law;
but the industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the
ambiguous language of the Old Testament, and the ambiguous con-
du& of the apostolic teachers. It was proper gradually to unfold
the system os the Gospel, and to pronounce with the utmost cantion
and tenderness a sentence of condemnation so repugnant to the incli-
nation and prejudices of the believing Jews.
