their errors3 but if we except the inimitable Lucian, this age of
indolence pass'cd away without having produced a single writer of
original genius, or who excelled in the arts of elegant composition.
'she authority of Plato and Aristotle, of Zeno and Epicurus, still
reigned in the school53 and their systems, transmitted with blind
defer-enee from one generation of disciples to another, precluded
every generous attempt to exereise the powers, or enlarge the limus,
of the human mind. The beauties of the poets and orators, instead
of kindling a fire like their own, inspired only cold and servile
imitations: or if any ventured to deviate from those models, they
deviated at the same time from good sense and propriety. On the
revival of letters, the youthful vigour of the imagination, after a
long repose, national emuladon, a new religion, new languages,
and a new world, called forth the genius of Europe. But the pro-
vincials of Rome, trained by a uniform artificial foreign education,
were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients,
who, by expreffing their genuine feelings in their native tonguc‚
had already occupied every place of honour. The name of Poet
was almost forgotten3 that of Orator was usurped by the sophists.
A cloud of crines, of compilers, of commentator-s, darkened the face
