THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been
adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudiee ⁶⁰. Yet confining

ourselvcs to the public seenes displayed before the Roman people,
and attested by grave and contemporary historiam, their inexpres-

fible iufamy surpaffes that of any other age or country. The license
of an eastern monarch is secluded from the eye of curiosity by the
inaceessible walls of his seraglio. The sentiments of honour and
gallantry have introduced a refinement of pleasure, a regard for de-
cency, and a respe& for the public opinion, into the modern courts
of Europe; but the corrupt and opulent nobles of Rome gratified
every vice that could be collected from the mighty conflux of nations
and manners. Seeure of impunity‚ careless of censure, they lived
without restraint in the patient and humble society of their ssaves
and parafites. The emperor, in his turn, viewing every rank of his
subjee‘ts with the same contemptuous inffifferenee, asserted without
control his sovereign privilege of lust and luxury.

The most worthless of mankind are not afraid to condemn in

others the same disorders which they allow in themselve33 and can
readily discover some nice, differenee of age, charaeten or station, to

justify the partial distinetion. The lieentiousffioldiers, who had

raised to the throne the dissolute son of Caracalla, blushed at their
ignominious choice, and turned with disgust from that monster, to
contemplate with pleasure the opening virtues of his cousin Alex-
ander the son of Mamaea. The crafty Maeffi, senfible that her grand-
son Elagabalus must inevitably destroy himself by his own vices,
had provided another and surer support of her family. Embraeing
a favourable moment of fondness and devotion, she had persuaded
the young emperor to adopt Alexander, and to invest him with the
title of Caesar, that his own divine occupations might be no longer

⁶⁹· Even the credulous compiler of his life, to suspe& that his vices may have been exag-⁴
‘ut the Augutian’ffistory (p= nr), isinclined gerated.
