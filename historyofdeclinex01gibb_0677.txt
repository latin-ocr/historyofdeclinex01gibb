appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The anclent ss-—v-—J

apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal truth and
severity, the irregular* condu& of their perseeutors‚ who, contrary
to every principle of judicial proeeeding, admitted the use of torture,
in order to obtain, not a confeffion, but a denial, of the crime which
was the obje& of their inquii-y ⁶⁴. The monks of succeeding ages,
who, in ‚their peaceful solstudes, entertained themselves with di-
versifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have
frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious
nature. In particular, it has pleased them to suppose, that the
zeal of the Roman magistrates, disdaining every consideration of
moral virtue or public deceney, endeavoured to seduce those whom
they were unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal
violence was offered to those whom they found it impoffible to seduce.
It is related, that pious females, who were prepared to despise death,
were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, and called upon to
determine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their
chastity. The youths to whose licentious embraces they were aban-
doned, received a solemn exhortation from the judge, to exert their
most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus against the
impious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars. Their
violence however was commonly disappointed‚ and the seasonable
interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses
of Christ from the dilhonour even of an involuntary defeat. &Vc
should -not indeed negle& to remark, that the more ancient as well
as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted With these
extravagant and indecent fiffions ⁶⁵.
