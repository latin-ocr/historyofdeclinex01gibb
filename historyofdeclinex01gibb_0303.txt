OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly contributed
to asswage the fiercer passions of human nature, it seems to have
been less favourable to the virtue of chastity, whose most dangerous
enemy is the softness of the mind. Thc refinements of life cor-
rupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes, The gross ap-
petite of love becomes most dangerous vvhen it is elevated‚ or
rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental passion. The elegance of
’ dress, of motion, and of manners, give a lustre to beauty, and in-
flame the senses through the imagination. Luxurious entertain-
ments‚ midnight dances, and licentious speetaeles‚ present at once
temptation and opportunity to female frailty ⁵⁷. From such dangers,
the unpolished wives of the barbarians were securcd‚ by poverty,
solitude‚ and the painful cares of a domestic life. The German huts‚
open, on every fide, to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a
better fase-guard of conjugal fidelity‚ than the walls, the bolts, and
the eunuchs of a Perfian haram. To this reason, another may be
added of a more honourable nature. The Germans treated their
women with esteem and confidence, consulted them on every occa-
fion of importance, and fondly believed, that in their breasts re-
fided a sanCtity and Wisdom‚ more than human. Some of these
interpreters of fate, such as Velleds„ in the Batavian war, governed
in the name of the deity, the fiercest nations of Germany ⁵⁸. The
rest of the sex, without being adored as goddesses, were respeeced as·
the free and equal companione of soldiers; associated even by the
marriage ceremony to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory ⁵⁹. In
their great invasions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with

a multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst
