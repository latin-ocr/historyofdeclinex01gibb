OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ‘3259

When Aurelian paffed over into Asia, against an adversary whose C ΗΧῙΛ Ρ-
sex alone could render her an object of contempt, his presence restored u--ssd
obedience to the province of Bithynia, already {haken by the arms and tilii? &iiiii

intrigues of Zenobia ⁶². Advancing at the head of his legions, he'ac- :pig zv..
cepted the submiffion of Ancyra, and was admitted into Tyana after l
an obstinate siege, by the help of a perfidious citizen. The generous

her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdas,
who had already fignalized his military talents by the conquest of

Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia, confisted for the most
