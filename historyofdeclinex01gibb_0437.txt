OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 4‘11

Perfians expreffed their desire of being introduced to the presence of C ij} P·
the Roman emperor. They were at length eonducsted to a soldier, ι--ψζζω
who was seated- on the grass. A piece of stale bacon and a few hard
pease composed his supper. A coarse woollen garment of purple

Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness, as-
