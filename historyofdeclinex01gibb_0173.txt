ment, was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party⁵²

Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a fingle city dc serves
an honourable exception As Byzantium was one of the gieatest
passages from Europe into Asia, it had been provided with a strong
garrison, and a fleet of five hundred vessels was anchored in the
harbour⁵³, The impetuosity of Severus disappointed this prudent
scheme of defence3 he left to his generals the fiege of Byzantium,
forced the less guarded passage of the Hellespont‚ and, impatient of
a meaner enemy, preffed forward to encounter his rival. Byzantium,
attacked by a numerous and increafing army, and afterwards by the
whole naval power of the empire, sustained a fiege of three years,
and remaiued faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citi·
zens and soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with
equal fury3 several of the principal officers of Niger, who despaired
of, or who disdained, a pardon‚ had thrown themselves into this last
refuge ε the fortifications were esteemed impregnable, and, in the de-
fence of the place, a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic
powers known to the ancients⁵⁴. Byzantium, at length, surrendered
to famine. The magistrates and soldiers were put to the sword, the
walls demolished, the privileges suppreffed, and the destined capital
of the east subfisted only as an open village, subje& to the- insulting
jurisdietion of Perinthus. The historiam Dion, who had admired
the flourishing, and lamented the desolate, state of Byzantium, ac-
