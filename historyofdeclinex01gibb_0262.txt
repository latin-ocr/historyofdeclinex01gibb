236 THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

C Hy Α P. centuries‚ an absolute empire over many countries of Europe, Asia,
ᾆξ’-υ and Africa. The last three hundred years had been consumed in
apparent prosperity and internal decline. The nation of soldiers,
magistrates, and legissators, who composed the thirty-five tribes
of the Roman people, was dilsolved into the ,common mass of
mankind, and confounded with the milliens of servile provincials‚
who had received the name, without adopting the -spirit of Romans.
A mercenary army, levied among the subjeeis and barbariam of the
sronder, was the only order of men who preserved and abused their
independence. By their tumultuary eleffion, a Syrian, a Goth, or
an Arab, was exalted to the throne of Rome, and invested with des-
potic power over the conquests and over the country of the Scipios.
The limits of the Roman empire still extended from the XVestern
Ocean to the Tigris, and from Mount Atlas to the R'hine and the·
Danube. To the undiscerning eye of the vulgar, Philip appeared
a monarch no less powerful than Hadrian or Augustus had formerly
been. The form was still the same, but the animating health and
vigour were fied. The industry of the people was discouraged and
exhausted by a long series of oppreffion. The discipline of the legions ‚
which alone, after the extinC‘tion of every other virtue, had propped
the greatness of the state, was corrupted by the ambition, or relaxed
by the weakness of the emperors. The strength of the frontiers,
which had always confisted in arms rather than in fortifications,
was insensibly undermined 3 and the fairest provinces were left ex-
posed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbariam, who soon-

discovered the decline of the Roman empire.
