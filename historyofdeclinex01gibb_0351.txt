OF THE ROMAN EMP‘IRE· 325

in their third naval invasion. The arts of Greece, and the wealth C HYA P.
of ΑΗΒ, had conspired to ere& that sacred and magnificent structure. w
It was supported by an hundred and twenty-seven marble columns
of ,the Ionio order. They were the gifts of devout monarchs, and
each was sixty feet high. The altar was adorned with the maslerly
sculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhapssselee’ted from the favou-
rite legends of* the place the birth of the divine children of Latona,
the concealment of Apollo after the ssaughter of the Cyelop3, ancl
the clemeney of Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons¹²⁹. Yet the
length of the temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty—
five feet, about two-thirds of the measure of the church of St.

Peter's at Rome ¹³⁰. In the other dimensione, it was still more in-
ferior to that sublime produecion of modern architectum. The
spreading arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth
than the oblong temples of the Pagans; and the boldest artists of
antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raifing¹ in
the air a dome of the fize and proportions of the pantheon. The
temple of Diana was, however, admit-ed as.one of the wonder-s-
of the world. Succeffive empires, the Perfian, the Macedonian,
and the Roman, had revered its sanetity, and enriched its splen-
domm. But the. rude savages of the Baltic were destitute of a taste
for the elegant arm, and they despised the ideal terr-ors of a foreign
superstition-¹ ³².
