commendation of Valeriam, a senator of the highest rank and merit,
Ulpius Crinitus, whose blood was derived from the same source as
that of Trajan, adopted the Pannonian peasant, gave him his daughter
in marriage, and relieved with his ample fortune the honourable
poverty which Aurelian had preserved inviolate ¹⁸. ὁ

The reign of Aurelian lasted only four years and about nine
month53 but every instant of that short period was filled by some
memorable atchievcment. He put an end to the Gothic war, chas-
tised the Germans who invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Spain, and
Britain out of the hands of Tetricus, and destroyed the proud mo-
narchy which Zenobia had erened in the East, on the ruins of the
afflieted empire.

It was the rigid attention of Aurelian, even to the minutest ar-
ticles of discipline, which bestowed such uninterrupted success on his
arms. His military regulations are contained in a very concise
epistle to one of his inferior officers, who is commanded to enforce
them, as he wishes to become a tribune, or as he is defirous to live.
Gaming, drinking, and the arts of divination, were severely pro-
hibited. Aurelian expeeled that his soldiers should be modest,
frugal, and laborious; that their armour should be constantly kept
bright, their weapons ssiarp, their cloathing and horses ready for
immediate service ; that they ssiould live in their quarters with chas-
tity and sobriety‚ without damaging the corn fields, without stealing
even a sheep, a fowl, or a bunch of grapes, without exasting from
their landlords either salt, or oil, or wood. “The public allow-⁷
