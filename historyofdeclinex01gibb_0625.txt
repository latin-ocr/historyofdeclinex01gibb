OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 599¹

From the imperious declamations of Cyprian, wc should naturally μ-..ν-α
conclude, that the doetrines of excommunication and pennance
formed the most effential part of religion; and that it was much
less dangerous for the disciples* of Christ to negle& the observance of
the moral duties‚ than to despise the censures and authority of
their bishops. Sometimes we might imagine that we were listening
to the voice of Moses, when he commanded the earth to open,
and to swallow up, in consuming flames, the rebellious race which
refused* obedience to the priesthood of Aaron 3 and we should some--
times suppose that we heard a Roman consul afferting the majesty·
of the republiC, and declaring his inflexible resoluti-on to enforce⁴
the rigour of the laws. ‘⁴ If such irregularities are suffered with⁷
‘⁶ impunity‚ (it is thus that the bishop of Carthage chides the

‘⁴ lenity of his colleague) if such irregularities are suffered, there

' ‘⁶ is an end of EpiscopAL mooun ¹⁴⁹; an end of the sublime and'

⁴‘ divine powerv of governing the chureh, arr end of Christianity·
“ itself.’'' Cyprian had renounced those temporal honours, which
it is probable he would never have obtained'3 but the acquisition of·
such absolute command over the conscienees and understanding of ἲν
congregation, however obscure or despised by the world, is more·
truly grateful to the pride of the human heart, than the poffeffioff
of the most despotic power, imposed by arms and conquest on a rem
luc‘lant people.

I'n the course of this important, though perhaps tedious, inquiry, Rem-,pirulam
I have attempted to display the secondary causes which so effica- gessem«
cioussy assisted the truth of the Christian religion. If among these
causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments, any accidental'
circumstances, or any mixture of error and passion, it cannot appear

surprismg that mankind should be the most senlihly ass-ested by
