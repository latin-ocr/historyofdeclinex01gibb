OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

when Galerius had obtained the supreme power and the government
of the East, he indulged in their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty,
not only in the provinces of Thrace and Afia, which acknowledged
his immediate jurisdicstion5 but in those of Syria, Palestine, and
Egypt, where Maximin gratified his own inclination‚ by yielding
a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor ¹⁷³.
The frequent disappointments of his ambitious views, the experience
of six years of persecution‚ and the salutary reflections which a
lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of Galerius,
at length convinced him that the most violent efforts of despotism
are insufficient to extirpate a whole people, or to subdue their
religious prejudices. Defirous of repairing the mischief that he
had occasioned, he published in his own name, and in those of
Licinius and Constantine, a general edict, which, after a pompous
recital of the Imperial tides, proceeded in the following manner.
