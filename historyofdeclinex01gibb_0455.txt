variably acknowledged, by their gratitude and obedience‚ the com·-
mon parent of their fortunes. The suspicions jealousy of power
found not any place among them; and the singular happiness of
their union has been compared to a chorus of music, whose har-
mony was regulated and maintained by the skilful hand of the first
artist ¹⁵.

This important measure was not carried into execution till about
fix years after the association of Maximian, and that interval of time
had not been destitute of memorable incidents. But we have pre-
ferred, for the sake of perspicuity‚ first to describe the more perse&
form of Diocletian’s government‚ and afterwards to relate the
aetions of his reign, following rather the natural order of the
events, than the dates of a very doubtful chronology.

The first exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few
words by our imperfedt writers, deserves, from its fingularity‚ to
