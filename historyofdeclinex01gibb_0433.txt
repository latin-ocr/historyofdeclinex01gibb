OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Pannonia, and two considerable spots are described, which were
entirely dug and planted by military labour ⁵⁹. One of these, known
under the name of Mount Almo, was fituated near Sirmium, the
country where Probus was born, for which he ever retained a

Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fadgue, on a sudden threw
