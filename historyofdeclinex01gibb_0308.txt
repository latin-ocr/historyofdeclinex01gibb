that during more than two hundred and fifty years that elapsed from
the defeat of Varus to the reign of Decius, these formidable bar-
barians made few considerable attempts‚ and not any material im-
preffion on the luxurious and enssaved provinces of the empire.
Their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline,
and their fury was diverted by the intestine divifions of ancient
Germany.

But the rude tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those
valuable metals, were reduced ssowly to acquire, by their unassisted
strength, the poffeffion of the one as well as the other. The face
of a German army displayed their poverty of iron. Swords, and the ⁴
longer kind of lances, they could seldom use. Theitfiwneae (as
they called them in their own language) were long spears headed
with a ssiarp but‘ narrow iron point, and which, as occafion re-
