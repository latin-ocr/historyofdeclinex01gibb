OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the fame of ancient heroes, and restored peace and order to every pro-
vince of the Roman world. The dangerous frontier of Rhaetia he so
firmly secured, that he left it without the suspicion of an enemy. He
broke the wandering power of the Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror
of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquilh their spoil. The
Gothic nation courted the alliance of so warlike an emperor ³⁰. He
attacked the Isaurians in their mountains, besieged and took several
of their ssrongest castles μ, and flattered himself that he had for ever
,suppreffed a domestic foe, whose independenee so deeply wounded the
majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurpet Firmus
in the Upper Egypt, had never been perfeffly appeased, and the
cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortilied by the alliance of the Blem-
myes, still maintained an obscure rebellion. The chastisement of
those eides, and of their auxiliaries the savages of the South, is said
to have alarmed the court of Persia ³², and- the great King sued in
vain for the friendship of Probus. Most of the exploits which dis-
tinguished his reign, were atchieved by the personal valour and con—
du& of the emperor, insomuch that the writer of his life expresses
some amazement how, in so short a time, a single man could be pre·-
sent in so many distant wars. The remaining actions he intrusted to
the care of his lieutenants, the judicious choice of whom forms no
inconsiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian‚ Maximian,
Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of
other chiefs‚ who afterwards ascended or supported the throne, were
trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus ³³.
