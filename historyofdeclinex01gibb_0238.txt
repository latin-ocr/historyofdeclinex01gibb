rors were melted down and coined into money. These impious or·
ders could not be executed without tumults and maffacres, as in many
places the peoplc chose rather to die in the defence of their altars,
than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the ra-
pine and cruelty of war. The soldiers themselves, among whom
this sacrilegious plunder was distributed‚ received it with a blush;
and, hardened as they were in adis of violence, they dreaded the just
reproaches of their friends and relations. Throughout the Roman
world a general cry of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance
on the common enemy of human kind ; and at length, by an a& of
private oppreffion, a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into
rebellion against him ¹².

The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy of such a master,
who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one of
the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue. An iniquitous
sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that
country, the execution of which would have stripped them of far
the greater part of their patrimony. In this extremity, a resolution
that must either complete or prevent their ruin, was dietated by
despair. A respite of three days, obtained with difficulty from the
rapacious treasurer‚ was employed in collecting from their estates a
great number of ssaves and peasants‚ blindly devoted to the com-
mands of their lords, and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs
aud axes. The leaders of the conspiracy, as they were admitted
to the audience of the procurator, stabbed him with the daggcrs
concealed under their garments, and, hythe affistance of their tu-
