OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

with his own applause, and the acclamations of the soldiers‚ whose
consent had been secured by an immense donative, the new Caesar ⁴¹
was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death. He left
only one son. Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the

Antoniues. He was adopted by Pius; and, on the accession of

Marcus, was invested with an equal ssiare of sovereign power.
Among the many vices of this younger Verus, he poffeffed one
virtue3 a dutiful reverence for his wiser colleague‚ to whom he
willingly abandoned the ruder cares of empire. The philosophie
emperor diffembled his follies, lamented his early death, and cast a

decent veil over his memor-y.

As soon as Hadrian’s paffion was either gratified or disappointed,
he resolvcd to deserve the thanks of posterity‚ by placing the most
exalted merit on the Roman throne. His discerning eye easily
discovered a senator about fifty years of age, blameless in all the
offices of life, and a youth of about seventeen, whose riper years

Antonines (for it is of them that we are now speaking) governed the
Roman world forty-two years, with the same invariable spirit of
