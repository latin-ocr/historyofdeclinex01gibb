OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

he was exposed were less imminent than those which temporal am·
bition is always prepared to encounter in the pursuit of honours.
Four Roman emperors, with their familieS, their favourites, and
their adherents‚ per-ilhed by the sword in the, space of ten years,
during which, the bilhop of Carthage guided by his authority
and eloqucnce the counsels of the African church. lt was only
in the third year of his administration, that he had reason, during a
few months, to apprehcnd the severe ediffils of Decius, the vigilance
of the magistrate, and the clamours of the multitude, who loudly
demanded, that Cyprian, the leader of the Christians, should be
thrown to the lions. Prudence suggested the neceffity of a tem-
porary retreat, and the voice of prudence was obeyed. He with-
drew himself into an obscure solitude, from whence he could
maintain a constant correspondence with the clergy and peo-
ple of Carthage; and concealing himself till the tempest was
past, he preserved his life without relinquishing either his power
or his reputation. His extreme cautiori did not however escape
the censure of the more rigid Christians who lamented, or the
reproaches of his personal enemies who insulted, a conduct which
-they confidered as a pusrllanimous and criminal *deser-tion of the
most sacred duty⁷⁷. The propriety of reserving himself for the
future exigencies of the church, the example of several holy
biihops⁷⁸, and the divine admonitions which, as he declares him-
self, he frequently received in vismns and extafies, were the reasons
alleged in his justification⁷⁹. But his best apology may be found
in the cheerful resolution, with which, about eight years afterwards,
he suffered death in the cause of religion. The authentic history
