Public, he caltnly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity,
and he was more than forty years of age, when a grateful regard
for the memory of the virtuous Agricola, extorted from him the
most early of those historical compositions which will delight and
instruet the most distant posterity. After making a trial, of his
strength in the life of Agricola and the description of Germany, he
conceived, and at length executed‚ a more arduous vvork; the his-
tory of Rome, in thirty books, from the fall of Nero to the acces-
fion of Nerva. The administration of Nerva introduced an age of
justice and prosperity, which Tacitus had destined for the occu-
pation of his, old age ³²3 but when he took a nearer view of his
subject, judghrg, perhaps, that it was a more honour-able, or a less
invidious office, to record the vices of past tyrants, than to ccle-
brate the virtues of a reigning monarch, he chose rather to relate,
under the form of annals, the ac‘tions of the four immediate luccefl'ors
of Augustus. To collect, to dispose, and to adorn a series or tuurlcore
years, in an immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant
with the deepest observations and the most lively images, was an un-
dertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of l'acitus himself during
the greatest part'of his life. In the last years of the reign ot Trajan,
Whilst the victorious monarch extended the power or· Rome beyond

its ancient limits‚ the historiam was describing, in the second and-
:fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of Tiberius ³⁹3 and the

emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne, before Tacitus,
in the regular prosecution of his work, could relate the fire ot the
capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christiane.
At the distance of lixty years, it was the duty of the annalist to
