of their contempt, and at last of their fears and jealousy. A
transaction however is related under the reign of Alexander Severus,
Which discovers that the restraint was sometimes eluded or sus-
pended, and that the Christians were permitted to claim and to
possess lands within the limits of Rome itself¹³⁸. The progress of
Christianity, and the civil confusions of the empire, contributed to
relax the severity of the laws, and before the close of the third cen-
tury many considerable estates were bestowed on the opulent churches
of Rome, Milan, Carthage‚ Antioch, Alexandria, and the other great
cities of Italy and the provinces.

stock was intrusted to his care without account or control; the
prelbyters were confined to their spiritual funffions, and the more

abuse of their confidence could not be very frequent, and the
general uses to which their liberality was applied, reflected honour
on the religious society. A decent portion was reserved for the
