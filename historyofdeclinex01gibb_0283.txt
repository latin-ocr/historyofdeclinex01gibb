OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

disciplined evolutione which harmonize and animate a confused
multitude, were unknown to the Pei-flans. They were equally un·
{killed in the arts of construfflng, befieging, or defending regular
fortifications. They trusted more to their numbers than to their
courage3 moreto their courage than to their discipline. The infantry
was a half—armed spiritless crowd of pensantS, levied in haste by the
allurements of plunder, and as easily dispersed by a victory as by a
