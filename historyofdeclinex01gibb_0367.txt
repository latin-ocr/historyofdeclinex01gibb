ceeding princes, unable to reduce them to obedience, either by arms x--v—-a
or policy, were compelled to acknowledge their weakness, by sur-

rounding the hostile and independent spot, with a strong chain of
fortificationsffs, which often proved insufficient to restrain the 111--

curfions of these domestic foes. The Isauriam, gradually extending

their territory to the sea-coast, subdued the western and mountainous

part of Cilicia, formerly the nest of those daring pyrates, against

whom the republic had once been obliged to exert its utmost force,

under the conduc't of the great Pompey ¹⁷⁹.

Our habits of thinking so fondly conoe& the order of the Famine and
universe with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of history pestu‘mce'
has been decorated with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon me-
teors, preternatural darkness, and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or
exaggerated ¹³⁰. But a long and general famine was a calamity ofa
more serious kind. It was the inevitable consequence of rapine and
oppreffion, which extirpated the produce of the present, and the
hope of future harvests. Famine is almost always followed by epi-
demical diseases, the effe& of scanty and unwholesome food. Other
causes must however have contributed to the furious plague, which,
from the year two hundred and fifty, to the year two hundred and
sixty-five, raged without interruption in every province, every
city, and almost every family, of the Roman empire. During some
time five thousand persons died daily in Rome3 and many towns,
that had escaped the hands of the barbarians, were entirely depopu-
lated ¹⁸¹.

We have the knowledge of a very curious circumstance, of some use ‹linffiienffiiffin

perhaps in the melancholy calculation of human calamities. An species.
