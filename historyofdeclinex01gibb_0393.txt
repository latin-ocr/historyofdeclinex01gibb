OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 367

parable prudence and fortitude. Their splendid victories over the C H A P·
Great King, whom they twice purfued as far as the gates of Ctefi- hag—⁴
phon, laid the foundations of their united fame and power. The

armies which they commanded, and the provinces which they had

saved, acknowledged not any other sovereigns than their invincible

chiefs. The senate and people of Rome revered a stranger who had

avenged their captive emperor, and even the insensible son of Vale-

rian accepted Odenathus for his legitimare colleague.

After a successful expedition against the Gothic plunderers of Asia, She revengos
the Palmyrenian prince returned to the city of Emesa in Syria. In- &garumnam
vincible in war, he was there cut off by domestic treason‚ and his
favourite amusement of hunting was the cause, or at least the occa-
fion, of his death ⁵⁶. His uephew, Maeonius, presumed to dart his
javelin before that of his uncle3 and though admonished of his error,
repeated the same insolence. As a monarch aud as a sportsman,
Odenathus was provoked, took away his horse, a mark of ignominy
among the barbarians, and chastised the rath youth by a short con-
finement. The offence was soon forgot‚ but the punishment was
remembered; and Maeonius, with a few daring affociates‚ affaffinated
his uncle in the midst of a great entertainment. Herod, the son of A.D. r257·
odenathus, though not of Zenobia, a young man of fa soft and effe—
minate temper ⁵⁷, was killed with his father. But Maeonius ob-
tained only the pleasure of revenge by this bloody deed. He had
scarcely time to assume the title of Augustus, before he was sacri-
ficed by Zenobia to the memory of her husband 5⁸.

With the affistance of his most faithful friends, she immediately and reigns

. over the East
filled the vacant throne, and governed with manly counsels Palmyra, and Egypt.
