OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

themselves, who gloried in the name of senators, sat, voted‚ and
divided with their equals.

To resume, in a few words, the system of the 'Imperial govern-
mentv3 as it was instituted by Augustus, and maintained by those
princes who understood their own interest and that of the people,
it may be defined an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms os a
commonwealth. The masters of the Roman world surrounded their
throne with darkness, eoncealed their irrefistible strength, and hum-
*bly profeffed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate,
whose supreme decrees they distated and obeyed ¹⁹.

The face of the court corresponded with the forms of the admini-
stration. The emperors, if we except those tyrants whose capricious
folly violated every law of nature and deeency, disdained that pomp
and ceremony which might offend their countrymen, but could
add nothing to their real power. In all the offices of life, they af-
fected to confound themselves with their subje&s‚ and maintained
with them an equal intercourse of vifits and entertainments. Their
habit, their palace, their table, were suited only to the rank of an

opulent senator. Their family, however numerous or splendid,

was composed entirely of their domestic ssaves and freedmen ²⁰.

Augustus or Trajan would have blushed at employing the meanesl:
of the Romans in those menia] offices, which, in the household and
bedchamber of a limited monarch, are so eagerly sol-ieited by the
proudest nobles of Britain.
