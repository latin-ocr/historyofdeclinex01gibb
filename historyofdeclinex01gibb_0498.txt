Two of the sides were near fix hundred, and the other two near seven
hundred feet in length. The whole was constructed of a beautiful
free-stone, extrae'ted from the neighbouring quarries of Trau or
Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself. Four streets,
*intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several parts of
this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment

conveyed along the walls. The range of principal apartments
was protened towards the south-west, by a portico five hundred and
