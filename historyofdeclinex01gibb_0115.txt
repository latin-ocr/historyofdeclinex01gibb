OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

During a long period of two hundred and twenty years, from
the establilhment of this artful system to the death of Commodus,
the dangcrs inherent to a military governmcnt were, in a great

measure, suspended. The soldiers were seldom roused to that
fatal sense of their own strength, and of the weakness of the civil

authority, which was, before and afterwards, produCtive of such
dreadful calamities. Caligula and Domitian were affaffinated in
their palace by their own domestics ε the convulfions which agitated
Rome on the death of the former, were confined to the walls of the
city. But Nero involved the whole empire in his ruin. In the
space of eighteen months, four princes perished by the sword ; and
the Roman world was {haken by the fury of the contending armies·
Excepting only this short, though violent, eruption of military
licence, the two centur-ies from Augustus to Commodus paffed away
unstained with civil blood, and undisturbed by revolutions. The
emperor was elected by the authority (ff the senate and the consent
of the fhldiers ³⁰. The legions respched their oath of fidelity, and
it requires a minute inspefflon of the Roman annals to discover
three inconsiderable rebellions, which were all suppressed in a few
months, and without even the hazard of a battle ³¹.

In elective monarchies, the vacancy of the throne is a moment
big with danger and mischief. The Roman emperors defirous to
spare the legions that interval of suspense, and the temptation of an
irregular choice, invefled their designed successor with so largea share
of present power, as should enable him, after their decease, to
