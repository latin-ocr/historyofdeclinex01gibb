OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Athens, collected a hasty band of volunteers, peasants as well as
soldiers, and in some measure avenged the calamities of his
country ¹²².

But this exploit, whatever lustre it might {hed on the declining
age of Athens, served rather to irritate than to subdue the undaunted
spirit of the northern invaders. A general conflagration blazed out
at the same time in every distri& of Greece. Thebes and Argos,
Corinth and Sparta, which had formerly waged suchmemorable wars
against each other, were now unable to bring an army into the field,
or even to defend their ruined fortifications. The rage of war,
both by land and by sea, spread from the eastern point of Sunium
to the western coast of Epirus. The Goths had already advanced
within sight of Italy, when the approach of such imminent danger
awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of pleasure. The
emperor appeared in arms3 and his presence seems to have checked
the ardour, and to have divided the strength, of the enemy. Nau-
lobatus, a chief of the Heruli, accepted an honourable capitula-
tion, entered with a large body of his countrymen into the service
of Rome, and was invested with the ornaments of the consular dig-
nity, which had never before been profaned by the hands of a bar-
barian ¹²4. Great numbers of the Goths, disgusted with the perils
and hardships ofa tedious voyage, broke into Maefia, with a design
of forcing their way over the Danube to their settlements in the
Ukraine. The wild attempt would have proved inevitable destruc-
tion,- if the discord of the Roman generals, had not opened to the
barbarians the means of an escape ¹²⁵. The small remainder of this
