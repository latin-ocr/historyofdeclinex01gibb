OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the inconfiderable forces which in this important contest two such
powerful monarehs brought into the field, it may be inserted, that
the one was suddenly provoked‚ and that the other was unexpedt-
edly surprised. The emperor of the W'cst had only twenty thou—
sand, and the sovereign of the East no more than five and thirty
thousand, men. The inferiority of number was, however, corn-
pensated by the advantage of the ground. Constantine had taken
post in a defile about half a mile in breadth‚ between a steep hill
and a deep morast, and in that situation he steadily expected and
repulsed the first attack of the enemy. He pursued his success,
and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions of Illyricum
rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms
in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The miffile weapons on
both fides were soon exhausted ; the two armies, with equal valour,
rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears, and the doubt-
ful contest had already Iasted from the dawn os? day to alate hour
of the evening‚ when the right wing, which Constantine led in
person, made a vigorous and decisive charge. The judicious retreat
of Licinius saved the remainder of his troops from a tofta! defeat3
but When he computed his loss, which amounted to infre than
twenty thousand men, he thought it unsafe to pass the night in the
presence os an active and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp
and magazines, he marched away with secrecy and diligence at the
head of the greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed be-
yond the danger of a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wisc,
his son, and his treasureS, which he had depolited at Sirmium.
Licinius paffed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on
the Save, hastened to colle& a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In
his ssight he bestowed the precarious title of Caesar on Valens, his
general of the lllyrian frontier ³⁹.
