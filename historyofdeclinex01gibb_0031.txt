OF THE ROMAN EMPTRE. 5

Carastacus, n'or the despair of Boudicea, nor the fanaticism of the C HIA Ρ·
Druids could avert the ssavery of their country, or res1st the steady cdv—a
progress of the Imperial generals, who maintained the national
glory, when the throne was disgraced by the weakest, or the most
vicious of mankind. At the very time when Domitian, confined to
his palace, felt the terrors which he inspired ; his legions, under the
command of the virtuous Agricola, defeated the collected force
of the Caledonians, at the foot of the Grampian hills3 and his fleets‚
venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation,
displayed the Roman arms round every part of the issand. The
conquest of Britain was considered as already atchieved ; and it was
the defign of Agricola to complete and ensure his success, by the
easy reduction of Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and
a few auxiliaries were sufficient ⁹. The western isse might be
improved into a valuable poffeffion, and the Britons would wear
their chains with the less reffldlance, if the prospe& and example of
freedom was on every fide removed from before their eyes.

But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal
from the government of Britain; aud for ever disappointed this
rational, though extensive scheme of conquest. Before his depar-
ture, the prudent general had provided for security as well as for
dominion. He had observed‚ that the issand is almost divided into
two unequal parts, by the oppofite gulfs, or as they are now called,
the Firths of Scotland. Across the narrow interval of about forty
miles, he had drawn a line of military stations‚ which was after-
wards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by a turf rampart
erected on foundations of stone¹⁰. This wall of Antoninus, at a
small distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glas-
