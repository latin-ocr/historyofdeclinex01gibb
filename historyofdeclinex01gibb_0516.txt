THE DECLINE AND FALL

expreffed his intentions‚ in the furious language of a barbarian, to
extirpate the senate, and to destroy the people by the sword. But
the skill of Maximian had concerted a prudent system of defence.
The invader *found every place, hostile, fortified‚ and inaceeffible;
and though he forced his way as far as Narni, within fixty miles

declaration of his paternal rega-rd for Maxentius, who might obtain
much more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtfulv
chance of war ²⁵. The offers of Galerius were rejeeoed with firm·

not long before he discovered, that, unless he provided for his safety
by a timely retreat, he had some reason to ap'prehend the fate of ·
Severus. The wealth, which the Romans defended against his ra-
