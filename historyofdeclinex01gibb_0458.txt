wealth of Caraulius was, on this occasion, very justly considered
as an evidence of his guilt3 and Maximian had already given orders
for his death. But the crafty Menapian foresaw and prevented the
severity of the emperor, By his liberality he had attached to his
fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and secured the barbarians
in his interest. From the port of Boulogne he sailed over to Britain,
persuaded the lchon, and the auxiliaries which guarded that Issand,
to embrace his party, and boldly affuming, with the Imperial

issand, provided on every slde with convenient harbours; the tem-
perature of the climate, and the fertility of the soil, alike adapted
for the produffion of corn or of vines; the valuable minerals with
which it abounded3 its rich pastures covered with innumerable
flocks, and its vvoods free from wild beasts or venomous serpents.
