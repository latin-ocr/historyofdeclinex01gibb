The vanquished emperor left behind him two children, a boy of
about eight, and a girl of about seven, years old. Their inoffenfive
age might have excited compaffion‚ but the compaffion of Licinius
was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him from exfingugfhing
the name and memory of his adversary. The death of Severianus
will admit of less excuse, as it was diet-ared neither by revenge
nor by policy. The conqueror had never received any injury from
the father of that unhappy youth, and the short and obscure reign
of Severus iu a distant part of the empire was already forgotten. But
the execution of candidianus was an a& of the blackest cruelty and
ingratitude. He was the natural son of Galerius, the friend and bene-
fad³oer of Licinius. The prudent father had judged him too young to
sustain the weight ofadiadem3 buthe hoped that under the proteffion-
of princeS, who were indebted to his favour for the Imperial purple,
Candidianus might pass a secure and honourable life. He was now
advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty
of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition,
was sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of Licinius ²³⁰. To
these innocent and illustrious vietims of his tyranny, we must add
the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that
prinee conferred on Galerius the title of Caesar, he had εἶναι him in
marriage his daughter Valeria, whose melancholy adventures might
furnish a very singular subje& for tragedy. She had fulfilled and even
surpaffed the duties of a wife. As she had not any children her-
self, {he condescended to adopt the illegitimate son of her husband,
