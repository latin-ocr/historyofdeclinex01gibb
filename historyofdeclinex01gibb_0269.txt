he accuses them of adoring Earth, XVater, Fire, the Winds‚ and
the Sun and Moon. But the Perfians of every age have denied the
charge, and explained the equivocal conduct, which might appear
to give a colour to it. The elements‚ aud more particularly Fire,
Light, and the Sun, whom they called Mithra, were the objests of
their religious reverence, because they considered them as the purest

symbols, the noblest producimus, and the most powerful agents Of
the Divine Power and Nature ¹³.

Every mode of religion, to make a deep and lasting impreffiou on
the humaniminss must exercise our obedience, by enjoining practices
of devotion, for which we can affign no reason; and must acquire

our esteem, by inculcating moral duties analogous to· the diCtates of
our own hearts. The religion of Zoroaster was abundantly provided
with the former, and poffeffed a sufficient portion of the latter. At
the age pf puberty, the faithful Persian was invested with a mys-
terious girdle‚ the badge of the divine protection3 and from that
moment, all the actions of his life, even the most indifferent, or
the most necessary, were sanCtified by their peculiar prayer5‚ ejacula-
tions, or genuflexions; the omiflion of which, under any circum-
stances, was a grievous sm, not inferior in guilt to the violation of
the moral duties. The moral duties‚ however, ofjustice, mercy, li-
berality‚ &c. were in their turn required of the disciple of zoroaster,
who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman, and to live with
Ormusd in a blissful eternity, where the degree of felicity will be

exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety ¹⁴.
