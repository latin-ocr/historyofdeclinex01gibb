THE DECLINE AND FALL

But the most important service which Probus rendered to the re-

μαψ-...ι public, was the deliverance of Gaul, and the recovery of seventy

A. D. 277.
He delivers
Gaul from

the invasion
of the Ger-
mans,

flourilhing cities oppreffed by the barbarians of Germany, who,
fincezthe death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with

:impunity ³⁴. Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders,
>we may-distinguish, with some degree of clearness‚ three great armies,

-or rather nations‚ succeffively vanquished by the valour of Probus.

He drove back the Franks into their morasses; a descriptive cir-
cumstance from whence we may infer, that the confederacy known
by the manly appellation of Free, already occupied the flat maritime
country, intersected and almost overflown by the stagnating waters
of the Rhine, and that several tribes of the Frifians and Batavians
had acceded to their alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a
confiderable people of the Vandalic race. They had wandered in
quest of booty from the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine.
They esteemed themselves 'sufficiently fortunate to purchase‚ by the
restitution of all their booty, the permiffion of an undisturbed retreat.
T hey attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their punish-
ment was immediate and terrible ³⁵. Butof all the invaders of Gaul,
the most formidable were the LygianS, a distant people who reigned
over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and Silesia ³⁶. In
the Lygian nation‚ the Arii held the first rank by their numbers
*and fierceness. “ The Arii (it is thus that they are described by the
“ energy of Tacitus) study to impr-ove by art and circumstances the
“ innate terrors of their barbarism. Their shields are black, their

u bodies are painted black. They chuse for the combat the darkest
