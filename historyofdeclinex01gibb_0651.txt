cestors. The voice of oracles, the precepts of philosophers, andv the
authority of the laws, unanimoussy enforced this national obligation.
By their lofty claim of superior sanctim, the Jews might provokc
the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure racc. By
disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their
contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous

this principle which protected the Jewish synagogue, afforded not
any favour or security to the primitive church. By embracing the

unnatural and unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties
of custom and education, violated the religious institutions of their

superstitions of his family, his city, and his province. The whole
body of Christians unanimoussy refused to hold any communion with
