oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 447

the Roman army received a total overthrow, which is attributed to C {HJ} P.
the rashness of Galerius, who, with an inconfiderable body of troops, uaev--d
attacked the innumerable host of the Persians ⁶⁴. But the confider-
ation of the country that was the scene of afflon, may suggest ano-
ther reason for his defeat. The same ground on which Galerius
was vanquished, had been rendered memorable by the death of
Crassus, and the ssaughter of ten legions. It was a plain of more
than fixty miles, which extended from the hills of Carrhae to the
Euphrates ; a smooth and barren snrface of sandy desert, without a
hillock, without a tree‚ and without a spring of fresh water⁶⁵. The
steady infantry of the Romans, fainting with hear and thu-st, could
neither hope for vi&ory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their
ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger. In
this situation they were gradually eneompaffed by the superior num-
bers, harassed by the rapid evolutions, and destroyed by the arrows of
the barbarian cavalry. The king of Armenia had fignalized his valour
in the battle, and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune.
He was pursued as far as the Euphrate33 his horse was wounded, ands
it appeared impossible for him to escape the vietorious enemy. In this
extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which he saw before*
hirn3 he dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armour was
heavy, the river very deep, and in those parts at least half a mile in
breadth⁶⁶; yet such was his strength and dexterity, that he reached·
in safety the opposite bank⁶⁷. With regard to the Roman gene-

ral, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape3 but when
