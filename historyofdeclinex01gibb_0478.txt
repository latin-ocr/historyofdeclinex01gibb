THE DECLINE AND FALL

in Media. The secret motive of Narses in this delay, had been to
colle& such a military force, as might enable him, though sin-
cerely desirous of peace, to negociate with the greater weight and
dignity. Three persons only affisted at this important conference‚
the minister Apharban, the praese& of the guarde, and an officer
who had commanded on the Armenian frontier⁷⁶. The first
condition proposed by the ambaffadm, is not at present of a very
intelligible nature3 that the city of Nisibis might be established

for the place of mutual exchange, or, as we should formerly have
termed it, for the staple of trade, between the two empires. There

is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes,
to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; bnt
as Nisibis was fituated within their own dominionS, and as they were
masters both of the imports and exports„ it ssiould seem, that
such restraints were the obje&s of an interna} law, rather than ofa
foreign treaty. To render them more essediual, some stipulations
were probably required on the fide of the king of Persia, which “
appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity, that
Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them. As this was the
only article to which he refused his consent, it was no longer in-
fisted 0113 and the emperors either suffered the trade to llow iu
its natural channels, or contented themselves with such restrictions,
as it depended on their own authority to establiffi.

As soon as this difficulty was removed, a solemn peace was
concluded and ratified between the two natione. The conditions of
a treaty so glorious to the empire, and so necessary to Persia,
may (leserve a more peculiar attention, as the history of Rome
presents very few transac'tions of a fimilar nature3 most of her wass,
