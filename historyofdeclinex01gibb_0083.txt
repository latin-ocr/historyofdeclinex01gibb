oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

whilst the sovereignty of the people was represented in the ma-
jestic edifices destined to the public use ⁷¹ ; nor was this republican
spirit totally extinguissied by the introduffilion of wealth and mo-
narchy. It was in works of national honour and benefit, that
the most virtuous of the emperors affected to display their magni-

which four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrancez
