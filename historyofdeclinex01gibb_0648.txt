and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of the hor-
rid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus,
and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with
the unsuspeCfing natives ¹3 and we are tempted to applaud the severe
retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a
race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to
