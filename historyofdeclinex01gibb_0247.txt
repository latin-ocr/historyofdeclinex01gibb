OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 2¹21

After the senate had conferred on Maximus and Balbinus an C 213⁶} P.

Rome ³⁰. The solemn rites of sacrifice were disturbed by a sedi· (ἓξξξώ
tion of the people. The licentious multitude neither loved the rigid
Maximus, nordid they sufficiently fear the mild and humane Balbinus.
Their increaling numbers surrounded the temple of Jupiter3 with ob-
stinate clamours they asserted their inherent right of consenting to
the election of their sovereign, and demanded, with an apparent
moderatiori, that, belides the two emperors chosen by the senate, a
third should be added of the family of the Gordians, as a just re·
turn of gratitude to those princes who had sacrificed their lives for
the republic. At the head of the city-guards‚ and the youth of the
equestrian order, Maximus and Balbinus attempted to cut their way
through the seditious multitude. The multitude, armed with sticks
and stones, drove them back into the Capitol. It is prudent to yield³
when the contest, whatever may be the iffue of it, must be fatal

to both parties. A boy, only thirteen years of age, the grandson
of the elder, and nephew of the younger, Gordian, was produced to
the people, invested with the ornaments and title of Caesar. The
tumult was appeased by this easy condescension3 and the two
emperor3‚ as soon as they had been peaeeably aeknowledged in Rome,
prepared to defend Italy against the common enemy.
