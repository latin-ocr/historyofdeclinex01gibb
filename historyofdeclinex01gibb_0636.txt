THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H VA P· the third century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed
k--v—-J by the abilities of Cypriam, and adorned by the eloquence of Lac·

tantius. But if, on the contrarmy we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we
must content ourselves with discovering, int the time of Marcus An·-
toninus, the feeble and united congregations of Lyons and Vienna; and

Paris, some scattered churches were supported by the devotion of va small

votion, but as it is seldom compatible with zeal, we may perceive and
larnent the languid state of Christianity in those provinces which had..

emperor Severus¹⁷⁴. But the obscure and imperfe&·origin of the>
western churches of Europe has been so negligently recorded, that
if we would relate the time and manner of their foundation, we
must supply the silence of antiquity by those legends which avaricc
or superstition long afterwards dictated to the monks in the lazy
gloom of their convents'⁷⁵. Of these holy romance8‚ that of the
