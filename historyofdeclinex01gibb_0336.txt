THE DECLINE AND FALL

P. tions of ideal conquerors, have acquiesced in a sentiment whose smi-

ὶ-ννῖἱύ plicity persuades us of its truth ⁶⁹. They suppose, that about the year

two hundred and forty ⁷⁰, a new confederacy was formed under the
name of Franks, by the old inhabitants of the Lower Rhine and the
Weser. The present circle of XVestphalia, the Landgraviate of

different. A peace of two hundred years has rewarded the wife and
honest policy of the Swiss. An inconstant spirit, the thirst of rapine,
