THE DECLINE AND FALL

exa& register was kept at Alexandria, of all the citizens entitled to
receive the distribution of corn. It was found, that the ancient
number of those comprised between the ages of forty and sevemy,
had been equal to the whole sum of claimants, from fourteen to
fourscore years of age, who remained alive after the reign of Gal-
lienus ¹⁸². Applying this authentie fa& to the most corre& tables
of mortality, it evidently proveS, that above half the poople of
Alexandria had perished5 and could we venture to extend the ana-
logy to the other provinces, we might suspect, that war, pestilence,

and famine, had consumed, in a few years, the moiety of the hu-
man species ¹⁸³.
