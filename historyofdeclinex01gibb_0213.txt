OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

re'straints were imposed on the insolent luxury of the Roman peo-
ple‚ the price of provisions, and the interest of money, were re-
duced, by the paternal care of Alexander, whose prudent liberality,
without distressing the industrious, supplied the wants and amuse-
ments of the populace. The dignity‚ the freedom, the authority
of the senate was restored; and every virtuous senator might ap-
proach the person of the emperor, without a fear, and without a
blush.

The name of Antoninus, ennobled by the virtues of Pius and
Marcus, had been communicated by adoption to the diffolute Ve-
rus, and by descent to the cruel Commodus. It became the ho-
nourable appellation of the sons of Severus, was bestowed on young
Diadumenianus, and at length prostituted to the infamy of the
high priest of Emesa. Alexander, though preffed by the studied,
and perhaps, sincere importunity of the senate, nobly refused the
borrowed lustre of a name; whilst in his whole condu& he laboured
to restore the glories and felicity of the age of the genuine An-

tonines ⁷⁸.
In the civil administration of Alexander, wisdom was enforced

⁷ ⁷ by power, and the people, senfible of the public felicity, repaid

their benefactor with their love and gratitude. There still remained a
greater, a more necessary, but a more difficult ente1·prise; the refor-
mation of the military order, whose interest and temper, confirmed by
long impunity‚ rendered them impatient of the restraints of dis-
cipline, and careless of the bleffings of public tranquillity. In the
execution of his defign the emperor affeeled to display his love,
and to conceal his sear, of the army. The most rigid oecononiy

⁷² See in the Hist. August. p. 116, ¹¹7· had enjoyed, almost atwelvemonth, the bles-
the whole contest between Alexander and the sings of his reign. Before the appellation of
senate, extrafted from the journals of that Antoninus was offered him as a title of ho-
assembly. It happened on the fixxh of March, nour, the senate wnizetl to see whether Alex-
probably of the year 223, when the Romans ander would not assi-ime it, εις a family name.
