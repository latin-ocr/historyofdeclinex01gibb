OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

In this general view of the persecution‚ which was first authorized
by the edidis of Diocletian, Ι have purposely refrained from describ-
ing the particular sufferings and deaths of the Christian martyrs. It
would have been an easy tassz, from the history of Eusebius, from
the declamations of Lactantius, and from the most ancient acts, to
colle& a long series of horrid and disgustful pi&ures‚ and to fill
many pages with racks and scourges, with iron hooks, and red hot
beds, and with all the variety of tortures which fire and stcel, savagc
bcasts and more savage executionem, could inflict on the human
body. These melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of
vifions and miracles destined either to delay the death, to celebrate
the triumph, or to discover the relies, of those canonized saints who
suffered for the name of Christ. ButI cannot determine what Ι ought
to transcribe, till I ain satisfied how much Ι ought to believe. The
gravest ofthe ecclefiastical historians, Eusebius himself, indireffly con-
sesses, that he has related whatever might rcdound to the glory, and
that he has suppreffed all that could tend to the disgrace, of reli-
gion ¹⁷³. Such an acknovvledgment will naturally excite a suspicion
that a writer who has so openly violatcd one of thc fundamental
laws of history, has not paid a very stri& regard to the ohservanec
of the other: and the suspicion will derive additional credit froin
the character of Eusebius, which was less tinCtured with credulity,
and more practised in the arts of courts‚ than that of almost any
of his contemporaries. On some particular occasionS, when ihc ina-
gistrates were exasperated by some personal moti-:es of interest or
