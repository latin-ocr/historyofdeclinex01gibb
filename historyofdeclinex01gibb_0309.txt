ssiouts and disordered rank83 and sommium, by the effort os native
valum, prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of
the Roman mercenarios. But as the barbarians poured forth their
wholevsouls on the first onset‚ they knew not how to rally'or to
retire. A repulse was a sure defeat; and a defeat was most com-
monly total destruC’tion. WVhen we recolleet the complete armour
of the Roman soldiers‚ their discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified
camps, and military engines, it appears a just·1nat[er of surprise
how the naked and unaffisted valour of the barbarians could dare to
encounter in the field, the strength of the legions, and the various
troops of the auxiliaries, which seconded their operations. The
contest was too unequal, till the introduc‘tion of luxury had ener-
vated the vigour, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had
relaxed the discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction 0f
barbarian auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended
with very obvious dangers, as it might gradually instru& the Ger-
mans in the arts of war and of policy. Although they were
admitted in small numbers and with the strietest precaufion, the ex-
ample of Civilis was proper to convince the Romans, that the danger
was not imaginary‚ and that their precautions were not always suffi-

to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius ⁷5, formed a great defign of
freedom and ambition. Eight Batavian cohorts, renowned in the
Wars of Britain and Italy, repaired to his standard. He introduced
