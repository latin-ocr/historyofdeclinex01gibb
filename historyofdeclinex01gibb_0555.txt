OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

confirmed their discipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and
there were among them a great number of veteram, who, after
seventeen glorious campaigns under the same leader, prepared them-
selyes to deserve an honourablc dismiffion by a last effort of their
valour '⁰5. But the naval preparatione, of Constantine were in every
respect mech inferior to those of Licinius. The maritime citics
of Greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the
celebrated harbour of Piraeus, and their united forces consisted of
no more than two hundred small vessels: a very feeble armament
if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped
and maintained by the republic of Athens during the Peloponnesran
war ¹⁰⁶. Since Italy was-no longer the seat of government‚ the
naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually
neglected3 and as the [hipping and mariners of the empire were
supported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that they
should the most abound in the industrious provinces of Egypt and
Afia. It is only surprismg that the eastern emperor, who pos-
seffed so great a superiority at sea, should have neglected the oppor-
tunity of carrying an offenfive war into the centre of his rival’s
-dominions.

Instead of embracing such an active resolution, which might have
changed the whole face of the war, the prudent Licinius expected
the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he
had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension
of the event. Constantine directed his march from Thessalonica
towards that part of Thrace, till he found himself stopped by the
