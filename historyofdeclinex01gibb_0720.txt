THE DECLINE AND FALL

receiving a legal sentence of death or banistnnent, he was permitted,
after a short examinadon, to return to his diocese¹⁷⁰. Such
was the happy condition of the Christian subje&s of Maxentius,
that whenever they were defirous of procuring for their own use
any bodies of martyrs‚ they were obliged to purchase them from
the most distant provinces of the East. A story is related of Aglae,
a Roman lady, descended from a consular family, and poffeffed of
so ample an estate, that it required the management of seventy-three
stewards. Among these, Boniface was the favourite of his mistress;
and as Aglae mixed love with devotion, it is reported that he was
admitted to share her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the
pious defire of obtaining some sacred relies from the East. She
intrusted Boniface with a considerable sum of gold, and a large
quantity of aromatics 3 and her lover, attended by twelve horsemen
and three covered chariots‚ undertook a remote pilgrimage, as far as

Tarsus in Cilicia ¹⁷¹:-

The sanguinary temper of Galerius, the first and principal au-
thor of the persecution‚ was formidable to those Christians, whom
their missortunes had placed within the limits of his dominions3
and it may fairly be presumed, that many persons of a middle rank,
who were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty‚
very frequently deserted their native country, and fought a refuge

in the milder climate of the West. As long as he commanded only
the armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could with difficulty either

find or make a considerable number of martyrs‚ in a warlike country,
which had entertained the miffionaries of the gospel with more
coldness and reluctanee than any other part of the empire ¹⁷². But
