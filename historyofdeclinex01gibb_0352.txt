THE DECLINE AND FALL

conceit 'of a recent sophist. We are told, that in the sack of Athens

ι-ζᾸ-..ι the Goths had collected all the libraries, and were on the point of

setting fire to this funeral pile of Grecian learning, had not one of
their chiefs, of more refined policy than his brethren‚ diffuaded
them from the design3 by the profounci observation, that as long
as the Greeks were addicted to the study of books, they would never
apply themselves to the exercise of arins ¹³³. The sagaeious coun-

Of the many princes of that ancient racc, Chostoes, king of Arme-

defended himself by the natural strength of his country; by the
perpetual resort of fugitives and malcontents; by the alliance of the
Romans, and, above all, by his own courage. Invincible in arms,

who asserted the freedom and dignity ofthe crown, implored the pro-
tefifion of Rome in favour of Tiridates the lawful heir. But the son
of Chosroes· was an infant, the 'allies were at a distance, and the

Persian monarch advanced towards the frontier at the head of an
irresistible force. Young Tiridates, the future hope of his country,
was saved by the fidelity of a servant; and Armenia continued
above twenty-seven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy
