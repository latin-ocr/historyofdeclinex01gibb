390 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Hx 1⁴¹} Ρ· Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal

mss) cities of the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica, Corinth,
and conti- Athens, Antioch, Alexan'dria, and Carthago, to claim their obe-

pride and power fell to the ground. The expiring senate displayed
a sudden lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished for
ever.
