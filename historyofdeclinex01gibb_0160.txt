of austerity‚ he stands accused of concealing most of the vices which
degrade human nature ¹⁷. But his accusers are those venal writers
who adored the fortune of Severus, and trampled on the ashes of an
unsuccessful rival. Virtue, or the appearances of virtue, recom-
mendcd Albinus to the conlidence and good opinion of Marcu83 and
his preserving with the son the same interest which he had acquired
with the father, is a proof at least that he was possessed of a very
flexible disposition. The favour of a tyrant does not always sup-
pose a want of merit in the object of it; he may, without in-

a man useful to his own service. It does not appear that Albinus
served the son of Marcus, either as the minister of his cruelties, or
even as the affociate of his plcasures. He was employed in a dis-
tant honourable command, when he received a confidential let-ter
from the emperor, acquainting him of the treasouable designs of
some discontented generals, and authorizing him to declare himself
the guardian and suceeffor of the throne, by assuming the title and
enfigns of Caesar ¹⁸. The governor of Britain wisely declined the
dangerous honour, which would have marked him for the jealousy‚
or involved him in the approaching ruin, of Commodus. He
courted power by nobler, or, at least, by more specious arts. On
a premature report of the death of the emperor, he affembled his
troops; and, in an eloquent discourse‚ deplored the inevitable mis-
chiefs of despotism‚ described the happiness and glory which their
ancestors had enjoyed under the consular government‚ and declared
his firm resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal
