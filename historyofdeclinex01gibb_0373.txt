OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

from their camp and counsels; and however he might applaud the
deed, we may candidly presume that, he was innocent of the know-
ledge of it ⁶. When Claudius ascended the throne, he was about
fifty-four years of age.

The fiege of Milan was still continued, and Aureolus soon dis-
covered, that the success of his artifices had only raised up a more
determined adversary. He attempted to negociate with Claudius a
treaty of alliance and partition. “ Tell him,” replied the intrepid
emperor, “ that such proposals should have been made to Gallienus;
“ he, perhaps, might have listened to them with patience, and ac-
“ cepted a colleague as despicable as himself⁷.” This ssern refusal,
and a last unsuccessful effort, obliged Aureolus to yield the city'and
himself to the discretion of the conqueror. The judgment of the
army pronounced him worthy of death, and Claudius, after a feeble
resistance, consented to the execution of the sentence. Nor was the
zeal of the senate less· ardent in the cause of their new sovereign.
They ratified, perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal, the clection
of Claudius; and as his predeceffor had shewn himself the personal
enemy of their order, they exercised under the name of justice a
severe revenge against his friends and family. The senate was per-
mitted to discharge the ungratesul office of punishment, and the ern-
peror reserved for himself the pleasure and merit of obtaining by his
interceffion a general a& of indemnity ³.
