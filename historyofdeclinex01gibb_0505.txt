or THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 479

ei'pal recommendation seems to have confisted in the want of merit or C {13¹} P.
personal consequence. The first of these was Daza, or, as he was af· k-v-——J
terwards called, Maximin, whose mother was the sister of Galerius».
The unexperienced youth still betrayed by his manners and lan-
guage his rustic education‚ when, to his own astonishment as well as
that of the world, he was invested by Diocletian with the purple, ex-
alted to the dignity of Caesar, and intrusted with the sovereign
command of Egypt and Syria ⁵. At the same time, Severus,
a faithful servant, addicted to pleasure, but not incapable of busi-
ness, was sent to Milan, to receive from the reluctant hands of
Maximian the Caesarean ornaments, and the poffeffion of Italy and
Africa ⁶. According to the forms of the constitution, Severus
acknowledged the supremaey of the western emperor; but he was-
absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius, who,
reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of ’
Italy to those of Syria, firmly established his power over three-
fourths of the monarchy. In the full confidence‚ that the ap-
proaching death of Constantius would leave him sole master of the
{oman world, we are affured that he had arranged in his mind
a long succeffion of future princes, and that he meditated his own
retreat from public lise, after he should have accomplished a glorious
reign of about twenty years ⁷.

But within less than eighteen months, two unexpec‘ted revolutions Ambition of

successful revolt of Maxentius.
