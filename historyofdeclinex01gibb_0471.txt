OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Mamgo, with his followers, retired to the banks of the Oxus, and
implored the protectior] of Sapor. The> emperor of China claimed
the fugitive, and alleged the rights of sovereignty. The Perfian
monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality, and with some difficulty
avoided a war, by the promise that he would banish Mamgo to the
uttermost parts of the West3 a punishment, as he described it, not

personal provvess; and, in the true spirit of eastern romance‚ de-
scribes the giants and the elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm.
It is from other information that we discover the distraeted state ofthe
Persian monarchy‚ to which the king of Armenia was indebted for
some part of his advantages. The throne was disputed by the am-

bition of contending brothers ; and Hormuz, after exerting without
