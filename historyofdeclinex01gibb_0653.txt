of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the affistance of the
senses, would, in proportion as it receded from superstition, find

learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation, served only
to confirm their hasty opinion, and to persuade them, that the prin-
ciple, which they might have revered, of the divine unity, was de-

faced by the wild enthufiasm‚ and annihilated by the airy specula-

which has been attributed to Lucian‚ whilst he affe&s to treat the
mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and con-

reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine perfeetions ¹¹.

It might appear less surprifing, that the founder of Christ-

to offer any resemblance, however distant or imperfect, with the
popular mythology3 and the legends of Bacchus, of Hercules, and
of AEscuhrpius, had, in some measure, prepared their imagination

for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form¹².

place, Triephon, who personates a Christian,
after deriding the Gods of Paganism, proposes
