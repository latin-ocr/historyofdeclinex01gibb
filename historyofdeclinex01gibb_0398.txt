THE DECLINE AND FALL

“ of the character and of the power of Zenobia. It is impoffible to
‘¹ enumerate her warlike preparationS, of ssoncs, of arrows, and of
‘⁶ every species of miffile weapons. Every part of the walls is pro·
“ vided with two or three halssae, and artificial fires are thrown
“ from her military engines. The fear of punishment has armed
“ her with a desperate courage. Yet still 1 trust in the protecting
⁵⁴ deities of Rome, who have hitherto been favourable to all my
‘¹ undei‘takings⁷⁰.'' Doubtful, however, of the protection of the
gods, and of the event of the siege, Aurelian judged it more pru-
dent to offer terms of an advantageous capitulation: to the queen,
a splendid retreat3 to the citizenS‚ their ancient privileges. His
proposals were obstinately rejected, and the refusal was accompanied
with insult.

The firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope, that in a
very {hort time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the
desert; and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the East,
and particularly the Perfian monarch, would arm in the defence of
their most natural ally. But Fortune and the perseverance of Aure-
lian overcame every obstacle. The death of Sapor, which hap-
pened about this time⁷', distrasted the councils of Perfia, and the
inconfiderable succours that attempted to relieve Palmyra, were eafily
intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor.

with his victorious troops from the conquest of Egypt. lt was then
that Zenobia resolved to fly. She mounted the fleetest of her dro-
medaries⁷²‚ and had already reached the banks of the Euphrate8‚
