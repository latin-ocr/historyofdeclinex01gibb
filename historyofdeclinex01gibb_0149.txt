so very inadequate to his extravagance, that, upon his death, no k-v—‘

more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted trea-
sury ⁵⁰, to defray the current expences of government‚ and to dis-
charge the preffing demand of a liberal donative‚ which the new
emperor had been obliged to promise to the Praetorian guards. Yet
under these distreffed circumstances, Pertinax had the generous firm-

ness to remit all the oppressive taxes, invented by Commodus, and
to cancel all the unjust claims of the treasury 3 declaring in a decree

of the senate, “ that he was better satisfied to administer a poor re-
“ public with innocence, than to acquire riches by the ways of ty-
“ ranny and dishonour.’' Oeconomy and industry he confidered as
the pure and genuine sources of wealth; and from thern he soon
derived a copious supply for the public necessities. The expence of
the household was immediately reduced to one half. All the instru-
ments of luxury, Pertinax exposed to public auffion ⁵¹, gold and
filver plate, chariots of a singular construction, a superfluous ward-
robe of sill< and embroidery, and a great number of beautiful ssaves
of both sexes; excepting only, with attentive humanity, those who
were born in a state of free‘dom, and had been ravished from the
arms of their weeping parents. At the same time that he obliged
the worthless favourites of the tyrant to refign a part of their ill-
gotten wealth‚ he satisfied the just creditors of the state, and unex-
pedtedly discharged the long arrears of honest services. He removed
the oppreffive restrictione: which had been laid upon commerce, and
granted all the uncultivated lands in Italy and the provinces, to those
