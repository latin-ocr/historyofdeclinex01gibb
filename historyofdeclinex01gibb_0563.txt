OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

an independeut and increafing state in the heart of the Roman
empire. ’

I. We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient
world, and the facility with which the most different and even hos-
tile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other's superstitious.
A single people refused to join in the common intercourse of man-
kind. The Jews, who, under the Assyrian and Persian monarchies,
had languiffied for many ages the most despised portion of their
ssaves ¹, emerged from obscurity under the succeffors of Alexander3
and as they multiplied to a surprising degree in the East, and after-
wards in the West, they soon excited the curiosity and wonder
of other nations ². The sullen obstinacy with which they main-

faintly disguised‚ their implacable hatred to the rest of human-kind ³.
Neither the violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the

The letter of this law is not to be found in
the present volume of Nloses. But the wife,
the humane Maimonides openly teaches, that
if an idolater fall into the water, a Jew ought.
not to save him from instant death. See Ras-
nage, Histoire des Juifx, l. vi. c. 28.

selves in a sort of occafional conformity, de·
rived from Herod, by whose example and
authority they had been seduced, the name
of Herodians. But their numbers were so in-
confiderable, and their duration so short, that
josephus has not thought them worthy of his
notice. See Prideaux’s Conneffion, vol.ii.
p. 285.
