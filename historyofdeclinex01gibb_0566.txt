was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody

ιο--ν-ω circumstances, that the victorious Jews were left in a state of irre-

concilable hostility with all their neighbours. They had been com-
manded to extirpate some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the
execution of the Divine will had seldom been retarded by the
weakness of humanity. With the other nations they were forbidden
to contra& any marriages or alliances, and the prohibition of re'-

tiles the faith of Moses, had never been inculcated as a precept of
the law, nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as
a voluntary duty. In the admiffion of new citizens, that unsoeial

were flattered by the opinion, that they alone were the heirs of the
covenant, and they were apprehensive of diminissiing the value of
their inheritance, by {haring it too eafily with the strangers of the

inconstant humour of polytheism than to the aestive zeal of his own
miffionaries ¹¹. The religion of Moses seems to be instituted for a
particular country, as well as for a single nation3 and if a stri&
obedience had been paid to the order, that every male, three times in
the year, should present himself before the Lord Jehovah‚ it would
have been impossible that the Jews could ever have spread themselves
beyond the nari-ow limite of the promised land ¹². That obstacle was
