or THE RoMAN EMP1RE.

petty officer of the revenue ³⁵; his own merit had raised him, in an
advanced age to the empire3 but his merit was rather useful than
ssiining‚ and his virtues were disgraced by a stri& and even sordid
parfimony. Such a prince consulted his true interest by the associ-
ation of a son, whose more splendid and amiable charaGoer might

turn the public attention, from the obscure origin, to the future

glories of the Flavian house. Under the mild administration of

Titus, the Roman world enjoyed a transient felicity, and his beloved
memory served to prote& above fifteen years, the vices of his brother
Domitian.

Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from the affaffins of Do-
mitian, before he discovered that his feeble age was unable to stem
the torrent of public disorders, which had multiplied under the long
tyranny of his predecessor. His mild disposition was respe&ed by
the good; but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous
character, whose justice ssiould strike terror into the guilty. Though
he had several relations, he fixed his choice on a stranger. He
adopted Trajan, then about forty years of age, and who com·-
manded a powerful army in the Lower Germany3 and immediately,
by a decree of the senate, declared him his colleague and succeffor
:in the empire ³⁶. It is fincerely to be lamented, that whilst we are
fatigued with the disgustful relation of Nero’s crimes and follics,
we are reduced to collect the actions of Trajan from the glimmer-
ings of an abridgment, or the doubtful light of a panegyric.
There remains, however, one panegyric far removed beyond the
suspicion of flattery. Above two hundred and fifty years after the
death of Trajan, the senate, in pouring out the customary accla-
mations on the acceffion of a new emperor, wished that he might
surpass the felicity of Augustus, and the virtue of Trajan ³⁷.
