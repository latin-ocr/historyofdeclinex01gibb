'When the name and honours of the church of Jerusalem had
been restored to Mount Sion, the crimes of heresy and schism-were
imputed to the obscure remnant of the Nazare-nes, which refused
to accompany their Latin bishop. They still preserved thei-r former
habitation of Pella, spread themselves into the villages adjacent to
Damascus, and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of Bou-ea,
or, as it is now called, of Alepp0‚ in Syria ²². The name of Nazarenes
was deemed too honourable for those Christian Jews, and they soon

received from the supposed poverty of their understanding, as well ⁷

as of their condition, the contemptuous epithet of Ebionites²³. In
a few years after the return of the church of Jerusalem, 'it became
a matter of doubt and controversy, whether a man who fincerely
acknowlcdged Jesus as the Meffiah, but who still continued to ob·-
serve the law of Moses, could possibly hope for salvation. The
humane temper of Justin Martyr inclined him to answer this ques-
tion in the affirmative5 and though he expreffed himself with the
most guarded diffidence‚ he ventured to determine in favour of such
an imperfest Christian, if he were content to praffise the Mosaie
cerernonies, without pretending to affert their general use or neces-

seems to have collested from Eusebius, Je-
rome, Epiphanius, and other writers, all the
principal circumstances that relate to the Na-
zarenes or Ebionites. The nature of their
opinions soon divided thern into a strieter and
a milder sest 3 and there is some reason to con-

ate an Ebion‚ the imaginary author of their
sect and name. But we can more safely rely
on the learned Eusebius than on the vehement
Tertullian, or the credulous Epiphanius.
According to Le Clerc, the Hebrew word
Eljonim may be translated into Latin by that
of Pauperes. See Hist. Erccclefiast. p. 477.
