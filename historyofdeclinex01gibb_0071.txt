in the interestingarticles of marriage,- testaments, and inhex'itances3

and the road of fortune was open to those whose pretenlions were

seconded· by favour or merit. The grandsons of the Ganls, vel-,0

provinces, and were admitted into the senate of Rome ³⁶. Their

ambition, instead of· disturbing the tranquillity of the state, was in-

timately conneaed‘ with its safety and greatness.

So senfible were the Romans of the influence of langnage over Divifiopof
national manners, that it was their most serious care to extend, with {Rfss'gff‘kffld
the progress of their arms, the use of the Lat-in tonguc³⁷. The P¹⁰¹¹¹³⁶e³²

docile than the west, to the voice of its victorious preceptors. This
obvious difference marked the two portions of the empire with a
distinffion of colours, which, though it was in some degree con⁴

more visxble, as the shades of night‘desccnded upon· the Roman*

versally adopted in Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Pannonia ³⁴⁵,

that the faint traces of the Punic or Celtic idioms were preserved.
