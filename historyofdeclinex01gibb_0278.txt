THE DECLINE AND FALL

thian cause; but the superior power of Rome exassed from them a
reluctant homage, which is still attested by their medals. After the
conclusion of the Parthian war under Marcus, it was judged pru-
dent to secure some substantial pledges of their doubtful fidelity.
Forts were construeted in several parts of the country, and a Roman
garrison was fixed in the strong town of Nifibis. During the trou-
bles that followed the death of Commodus, the princes of Osrhoene
attempted to shake off the yoke: but the stern policy of Severus
confirmed their dependence ⁴⁵, and the perfidy of Caracalla com·
pleted the easy conquest. Abgarus, the last king of Edeffa, was sent
in chains to Rome, his dominions reduced into a province, and his
capital dignified with the rank of colony; and thus the Romans,
about ten years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy‚ obtained
a firm and permanent establishment beyond the Euphrates ⁴⁶.
Prudence as well as glory might havejustified a war on the side of
Artaxerxes, had his views been confined to the defence or the acqui-
fition ofa useful frontier. But the ambitious Persian openly avowed a

far more extensive defign of conquest3 and he thought himself able
to support his lofty pretenfions by the arms of reason as well as by

those of power. Cyrus, he alleged, had first subdued, and his suc-
ceffors had for a long time possessed, the whole extent of Asta, as
far as the Propontis and the AEgaean Sea; the provinces of Caria
and Ionia, under their empire, had been governed by Perfian scau-aps,
and all Egypt, to the confines of AEthiopia, had acknowletlged their
sovereignty ⁴⁷. Their rights had been suspended, but not destroyed,
by along usurpation; and as soon as he received the Persian dia-
