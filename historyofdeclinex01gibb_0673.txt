and in the provinces. From his ignorance therefore we may derive
some useful informatIOn. We may affure ourselves, that when he
accepted the government of Bithynia, there were no general laws
or decrecs of the senate in force against the Christians ; that neither

the difficulty of fixing any general plan3 but he lays down two-
salutary rules, which often afforded relief and support to the

such persons as are legally convieted, he prohibits thern, with
a very humane inmnststemy, from making any inquiries concern-r
