THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HIA P. to the exercise of arms, was fought for in the country rather than

h—j-—J in cities; and it was very reasonably presumed, that the hardy oc-

cupations of smiths, carpenters‚ and huntsmen‚ would supply more
vigour and resolution, than the sedentary trades which are employed
in the service of luxury ³². After every qualification of property
had been laid afide, the armies of the Roman emperors were still
commanded, for the most part, by Officers of a liberal birth and edu-
cation; but the common soldiers‚ like the mercenary troops of mo-
dern Europe, were drawn from the meanest, and very frequently

from the most profligate, of mankind.
That public virtue which among the ancients was denominated

patriotism is derived from a. strong sense of our own interest in the
preservation and prosperity of the free government of which we are
members. Such a sentiment, which had rendered the legions of the
republic almost invinciblc, could make but a very feeble impreffion
on the mercenary servants of a despotic prince; and it became ne-
ceffary to supply that dese& by other modves, ofa different, but not
less forcible nature3 honour and reiigion- The peasant‚ or mecha-
nic, imbibed the useful prejudice that he was advanced to the more
dignified profession of arms, in which his rank and reputation would
depend on his own valour ε and that, although the prowess of a pri-
vate soldier must often escape the notice of fame, his own behaviour
might sometimes confer glory or disgrace on the company, the le-
gion, or even the army, to whose honours he was associated. On
his first entrance into the service, an oath was administered to him,
with every circumstance of solemnity. He promised never to desert
his standard, to submit his own will to the commands of his leaders,
and to sacrifice his life for the safety of the emperor and the em·-
pire ³³. The attachment of the Roman troops to their standards,
