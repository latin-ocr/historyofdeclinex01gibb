oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. '493

An incurfion of the Franks had summoned Constantine, with a 0313.P‘

part of his army, to the banks of the Rhine; the remainder of k-v—..a
the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul, which
lay exposed to the enterprises of the Italian emperor, and a con-
fiderable treasure was depofited in the city of Arles. Maximian
either craftily invented, or hastily credited, a vain report of the
death of Constantine. Without hesitation he ascended the throne,
seized the treasure, and scattering it with his accustomed profusion
among the soldiers‚ endeavoured to awakein their minds the
memory of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could
establistx his authority, or finish the negociation which he appears
to have entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Con-
stantine defeated all his hopes. On the first news of his perfidy and·
ingrafflude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to
the Saone, embarked on the last mentioned river at chalons,
and at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived
at the gates of Arles, with a military force which it was iin-
poffible for Maximian to relist, and which scarcely permitted him to
take refuge in the neighbouring city of Marseilles. The narrow neck
of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against
the befiegers, whilst the sea was open, either for the escape of
Maximian‚ or for the succours of Maxentius, if the latter ssiould
chuse to disguise his invasion of Gaul, under the honourable
pretence of defending a distreffed, or, as he might allege, an >
injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay‚
Constantine gave orders for an immediate all'ault3 but the staling
ladders were found too short for the height of the walls, and
Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did
against the arms of Caesar, if the garrison, conscious either of their
fault or of their danger, had not purchased their pardon by de·-
livcring up the city and the person of Maximian. A secret but Hisdeath.
