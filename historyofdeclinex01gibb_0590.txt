THE DECLINE AND FALL

Whilst the happiness and glory of a tempora] reign were promised

aa& to the disciples of Christ, the most dreadsul calamities were de-

tion ofRome nounced against an unbelieving world. The edification of the New

and of the
world

Jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the
mystic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned before
Constantine perfisted in the profession of idolatry‚ the epithet of
Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome. A re-
gular series was prepared of all -the moral and phyfical 'evils which

can afflict a flourishing nati0n3 intestine discord‚ and, the invasion -

of the fiercest 'barbarians from the unknown regions of the North ;
pestilence and famine, comets and eclipses, earthquakes and inun-

dations ⁶³. All these were only so many preparatory and alarming

{ign-s of the great catastrophe of Rome, when the country of the
Scipios and Caesars should be consumed by a flame from Heaven,
and the city of the seven hills, with her palaces, her temples,
and her triumphal arches, should be buried in a vast lake of fire
and brimstone. It might, however, afford some consolation to
Roman vanity, that the period of their empire would be that of
the world itself; which, as it had once perissied by the clement of

water, was destined to experience a second and a sneedy ἀείὶτυξὶίοη

the {aith of the Christian very happily coincided with the tradition

we mnylearn from the complaintof Sulpicius infallibility on all the books of Scriptum,
Severus, that their sentence had been ratified contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the num-

by the greater number of Christians of his
time. From what causes then is the Apoca-
lypse at plesent so generally received by the
Greek, 1120 Roman, :ind the Protestant
timi-ches? 'she following ones may be :ts-
ligned. 1. The Greeks were snbdued by
the authority of an impostor, who, in the
finili century, assumed thr: cham-:302- of Dio-
nylius the Areopagite. 2. A just apprchen-
fion, that the grammarians might become
more important than the theologialis‚ engaged
the ceuncil of 'frent to fix the seal of their

ber of which the Apocalypse was fortunately ι

included. (Fra ΡῑιοΙο, moria dcl Concilio
Tridentino, 1. ii.) 3. The adusantage of
turning those mysterious proph-ecies against
tlte Sec of Rome, inspired the prottilants with
uncomnion veneration for so uscful an ally.
