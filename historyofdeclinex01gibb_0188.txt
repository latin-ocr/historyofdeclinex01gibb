of the Thracian Bosphorus, to guard the frontiers of the rival
monarchies5 and that the senators of Europcan extraction should ac*-
knowledge the sovereign of Rome, whilst the natives of Asia fol-

interrupted the negociation‚ the first idea of which had filled every
Roman breast with surprise and indignation. The mighty mass of
conquest was so intimately united by the hand of time and policy„
that it required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder. The
Romans had reason to dread, that the disjointed members would soon
be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of one master; but
ift'ne separation was permanent, the divifion of the provinces must
terminate in the diffolution of an empire whose unity had hitherto
remained ‘inviolate ²⁰.

might soon have been the conqueror of Afia ; but Caracalla obtained
an easler though a more guilty victory. He¹ artfully listened to his
mother's entreaties, and consented to meet his brother in her apart-

selves, rulhed with drawn swords upon the unfortunate Geta. His

distracted mother strove to prote& him in her arms3 but, in the un-
availing struggle, ssie was wounded in the hand, and covered with
the blood of her younger son, while ssie saw the elder animating and
assisting²¹ the fury of the affassins. As soon as the deed was per-
