The tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the resolution of u-—v-a

the high priest of Emesa. Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, he ap-
peared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants, armed only
with ssings, and defended his god and his property from the saeri-
legious hands of the followers of Zoroaster ¹4³. But the ruin of
Tarsus, and of many other eines, furnilh a melancholy proof
that, except in this singular instance, the conquest of Syria and
Cilicia scarcely inter-rupted the progress of the Perfian arms. The
advantages of the narrow paffes of mount Taurus were abandoned,
in which an invader‚ whose principal force confisted in his cavalry,
would have been engaged in a very unequal combat ε and Sapor was

city, though of the second rank, which was supposed to contain
four hundred thousand inhabitants. Demosthenes commanded in

displayed the mild aspect of a legissator, shewed himself to the Ro-
