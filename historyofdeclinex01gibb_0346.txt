THE DECLINE AND FALL

the western coast of the Euxine, paffed before the wide mouths of
the Borysthenes, the Niester‚ and the Danube, and increafing their
ficet by the capture of a great number of fissxing barks‚ they ap-
proached the narrow out—let through which the Euxine sea pours its
waters into the Mediterranean, and divides the continents of Europe
and Afia. The garrison of Chalcedon was encamped near the
temple of Jupiter Urius, on a promontory that commanded the
entrance of the Strait: and, so inconsiderable were the dreaded in-
vafions of the barbarians, that this body of troops surpass‘ed in num-
ber the Gothic army. But it was in numbers alone that they sur-
pass'ed it. They deserted with precipitation their advantageous
post, and abandoned the town of Chalcedon, most plentifully stored
with arms and money, to the discretion of the conquerors. Whilst
they 11efitated whether they should prefer the sea or land, Europe
or Afia, for the scene of their hostilities, a perfidious fugitive pointed
out Nicomedia, once the capital of the kings of Bithynia, as a
rich and easy conquest. He guided the march, which was only
fixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon ¹¹², direfied the rcsistless
attack, and partook ofthe booty; for the Goths had learned sufficient

⁶policy to reward the traitor‚ whom they detested. Nice, Prusa,
Apaemaea, Cius, cities that had sometimes rivalled, or imitated, the

splendour of Nicomedia, were involved in the same calamity, which,
in a *few weeks, ragcd without controul through the whole province
of Bithynia. Three hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the soft
inhabitants of Asia, had abolished the exercise of arms, and removed

the apprehenszon of danger. The ancient walls were suffered
to moulder away, and all the revenue of the most opulent

cities was reservcd for the construction of hams, temples, and
theatres ¹¹³.
