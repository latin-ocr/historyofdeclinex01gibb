OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 487

the West was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa C {411ss P.
a few miles distant from the capital. The gloomy passions of his ι-Ὓ-ὴλ
soul, shame, vexation‚ and rage, were inflamed by envy on the
news of Constantine's success3 but the hopes of Maxentius revived

to the party of Maxentius ²².

According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague, Des-eatan&
the emperor Severus immediately hastened to Rome, in the full ἐξζιξζζοῑδε*

confidence, that, by his unexpe&ed celerity, he should easily sup-
press the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licen-

tious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut
