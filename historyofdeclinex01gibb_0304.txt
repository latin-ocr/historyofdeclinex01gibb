Germans have more than once been driven back upon the enemy,
by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much
less than servitude. lf the day was irrecoverably lost, they well
knew how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own
hands, from an insulting vietorffl. Heroines of such a cast may
claim our admirati0n3 but they were most ayffuredly, neither lovely,
nor very suseeptible of love. Whilst they affected to emulate the
stern virtues of man, they must have resigned that atu-active softness
in which principally consist the charm and weakness of woman.
Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress every tender
emotion that stood in competition with honour, and the first honour
of the sex has ever been that of chastity. The sentiments and,
conduet of these high-spirited matrons may, at once, be considered
as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of the general character of
the nation. Female courage, however it may be raised by fanaticism,
or confirmed by habit, ean be only a faint and imperfect imitation
of the manly valour that distinguissies the age or country in which
it may be found.
