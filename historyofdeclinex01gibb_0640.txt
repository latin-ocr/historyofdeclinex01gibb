through the world, rit was embraced by several persons who derived
some consequence from the advantages of nature or fortune. Aristides,
who presented an eloquent apology to the emperor Hadrian, was
an Athenian philosopher ¹²³⁵. Justin Mart-yr had fought divine
knowledge in the schools of Zeno, of Aristone, of Pythagoras, and
of Plato, before he fortunately was accosted by the oldman, or rather
the angel, who turned his attention to the study of the Jewissa
prophete ¹⁸⁶. Clemens of Alexandria had acquired much various
reading in the Greek, and Tertullian in the Latin, language. Julius
Africanus and Origen poffeffed a very confiderable {hare of the
learning of their times; and although the style of Cyprian is very
different from that of Lactantius, we might almost discover that
both those writers had been *public teachers of rhetoric. Even the
study of philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians,
but it was not always productive of the most salutary effefts;

knowledge was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion, and
the description which was designed for the followers of Artemon,
may, with equal propriety, be applied to the various sens that
resisted the succeffors of the apostles. “ They presume to a'lter

“ The science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry‚
