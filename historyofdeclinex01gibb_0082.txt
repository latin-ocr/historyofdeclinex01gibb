surrounded by sophists, who acknowledged, without reluetance, the
superiority of a rich and generous rival⁶⁹. The monuments of his
genius have perissied 3 some considerable ruins still preserve the farne
of his taste and munificence: modern travellers have measured the
remains of the stadium which he construeted at Athens. It was fix
hundred feet in length, built entirely of white marble‚ capable of

⁸ admitting the whole body of the people, and finished in four years,

whilst Herod was president of the Athenian games. To the memory
of his wife Regilla, he dedicated a theatre‚ scarcely to be paralleled
in the empire: no wood except cedar, very curiously carved, was
employed in any part of the building. The Odeum, designed by
Pericles for musical perfmmance, and the rehearsal of new tragedies‚
had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over Barbarie greatness ;
as the timbers employed in the construction consisted chiefly of the
masts of the Persian vessels. Notwithstanding the repairs bestowed
on that ancient edifice by a king of Cappadocia, it was again fallen
to decay. Herod restored its ancient beauty and magnificence.
Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen confined to the walls
of Athens. The most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple
of Neptune in the Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a stadium at Delphi,
a bath at Thermopyhz, and an aqueduet at Canusium in Italy,
were insufficient to exhaust his treasures. The people of Epirus3
Thessaly, Euboea, Boeotia, and Peloponnesus, experienced his fa-
vours; and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Asia grate-
