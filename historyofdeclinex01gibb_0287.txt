feelings, or the expreffions, of an orator, born in the happier regions
of Greecc or Afia. But I shall selec‘t two remarkable circumstances
of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great rivers which covered the
Roman provinces, the Rhine and the Danube, were frequently frozen
over, and capable of supporting the most enormous weights. The
barbariam, who often chose that severe season for their inroads,
transported, without apprehension or danger, their numerous armies,
their cavalry, and their heavy waggons, over a vast and solid bridge
of ice ³. Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phte-
nomenon. 2. The rein deer, that useful animal, from whom the
savage of the North derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is
of a constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense
cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of
the Pole; he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and Siberia ;
but at present he cannot subsist, much less multiply, in any country
to the south of the Ealtic ⁴. In the time of Caelirr, the rein deer, as
well as the elk, and the wild bull, was a native of the Hercyniam
forest, which then overshadowcd a great part of Gerniany and Po-
land ⁵. The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes
of the diminution of the cold. These immense woods have been
gradually cleared, which intercepted from the earth the says
