concerning the truth of those doetrines, to which they had yielded
the most implicit belief. The decline of ancient prejudise exposed a

comfortless situation. A state of scepticism and suspence may amuse
a few inquisitive minds. But the practice of superstition is so conge-
nial to the multitude, that if they are forcibly awakened, they still
regret the loss of their pleasrng vilion. Their love of the marvellous
and super-natural, their curiosity with regard to future events,
and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond.
the limits of the visible world, were the principa] causesv which
favoured the establishment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar is
the neceflity of believing, that the fall of any system ofmythology will
most probably be succeeded by the introduCtion of some other mode
of superstition. Some deities of a more recent and fassiionable cast
might soon have occupied the deserted temples of Jupiter and
Apollo, if, in the decifive moment, the wisdom of Providence had*
not interposed a genuine revelation, fitted to inspire the most
rational esteem and convicffion, whilst, at the same time, it was
adorned with all that could attra& the curiosity, the wonder, and
the veneration of 'the people. In their actual disposition, as many

susceptible and defirous of a devout attachment3 an obje& much
less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant place in
their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of their paffions, ¹
Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection, instead of viewing
with astonishment the rapid progress of Christianity, will perhaps
be surprised that its success was not still more rapid and still more

‚ universal.
