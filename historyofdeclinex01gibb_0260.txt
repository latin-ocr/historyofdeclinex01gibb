After a moment's pause the inhuman sentence was executed ⁵⁵.

On his return from the east to Rome, Philip, defirous of obli-
terating the memory of his crimes, and of captivating the affections
of the people, solemnized the secular games with infinite pomp
and magnificence. Since their institution or revival by Au-
gustus ⁵⁶, they had been celebrated by Claudius, by Domitian, and

pope pretended, that he only rcvived an an-
