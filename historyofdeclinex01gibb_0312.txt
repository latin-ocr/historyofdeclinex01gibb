‚THE DECLINE AND FALL

The general conspiracy which terrilied the Romans under the
reign of Marcus Antoninus, comprehended almost all the nations of
Germany, and even Sarmatia, from the mouth of the Rhine to that
of the Danube⁸². It is impoffiblc for us to determine whether
this hasty confederation was formed by neceffity, by reason, or by
passion; but we may rest affured, that the barbarians were neither
allured by the indolence, or provoked by the ambition, ofthe Roman
monarch. This dangerous invasion required all the firmness and
vigilance of Marcus. He fixed generals ot ability in the several
stations of attack‚ and affumed in person the conclu& of the most
important province on the Upper Danube. After a long and doubt-
ful conflict, the spirit of the barbarians was subdued. The Qadi
and the Marcomanni ³³, who had taken the lead in the war, were
the most severely punistied in its catastrophe. They were com-
manded to retire five miles '⁴ from their own banks of the Danube,
and to deliver up the flower of the youth, who were immediately
sent into Britain, a remote issand, where they might be secure as
hostages, and useful as soldiers⁸⁵. On the frequent rebellions of
the Qadi and Marcomanni, the irritated emperor resolved to reduce
their country into the form of a province. His defigns were dis-
appointed by death. This formidable league, however, the only
one that appears in the two first centuries of the Imperial history,
was entirely diffipated, without leaving any traces behind in Germany,

selves to the general outlines of the manners of Germany, without
