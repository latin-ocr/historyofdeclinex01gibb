whose valour and dexterity he endeavoured to emulate in the daily
course of his ferocious amusements ³².

Elated with these praises‚ which gradually extinguished the in-

flattery, fear, and curiosity, attrasted to the amphitheatre an innu-
merable multitude of spe&ators; and some degree of applause was
deservedly bestowed on the uncommon skill of the Imperial per-
former. W'hether he aimed at the head or heart of the animal, the
wound was alike certain and mortal. With arrows, whose point
was shaped into the form of a crescent, Commodus often inter-

ostrich ³³. A panther was let loose; and the archer waited till he
had leaped upon a trembling malefactor. In the same instant the

dead as they ran raging round the Arena. Neither the huge bulk
of the elephant, nor the scaly hide of the rhinoceros, could defend
