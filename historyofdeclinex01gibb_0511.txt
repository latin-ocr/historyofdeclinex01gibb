OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ΙΙ. The ambitious spirit of Galerius was scarcely reconciled to the
disappointment of his views upon the Gallie provinces, before the
unexpee‘ted loss of Italy wounded his pride as well as power in a
still more senfible part. The long absence of the emperors had
filled Rome with discontent and indignation; and the people gra-
dually discovered, that the preference given to Nicomedia and Milan,
was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of Diocletian,
but to the permanent form of government which he had instituted.
lt was—in vain that, a few months after his abdication‚ his succes-
sors dedicated, under his name, those magnificent baths‚ whose
ruins still supply the ground as well as the materials for so many
churches and convents ²⁰. The tranquillity of those elegant
receffes of ease and luxury was disturbed by the impatient
murmurs of the Romans3 and a report was insenfibly circu-
lated, that the sums expended in ereeting those buildings, would
soon be required at their hands. About that time the avarice of
Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the state, had induced him
to make a very stri& and rigorous inquisition into the property of
his subjec‘ts for the purpose of a general taxation, both on their
lands and on their persons. A very minute survey appears to have
been taken of their real estates; and wherever there was the ssightest
suspicion of concealment, torture was very freely employed to ob-
tain a smeere declaration of their personal wealth ²¹. The privi-›
leges which had exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces,
were no longer regarded: and the officere of the revenue al-
ready began to number thevRoman people, and to settle the pro--v
