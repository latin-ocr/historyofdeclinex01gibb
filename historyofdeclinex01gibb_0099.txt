to the house of Caesar, from whence alone they had received, and k—-v-—J

expested, the most lavish rewards. The pro vinces, long oppresscd
by the ministers of the republic‚ fighed for the government of a
> single person, who would be the master, not the accomplice, of
those petty tyrants. The people of Rome, viewing, with a secret
pleasure‚ the humiliation of the aristocracy, demanded only bread
and public {hows3 and were supplied with both by the liberal hand
of Augustus. The rich and polite Italians, who had almost univer-
sally embraced the philosophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the present
bleffings of ease and tranquillity‚ and suffered not the pleasmg dream
to be inter-rupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom.
With its power, the senate had lost its dignity3 many of the most
noble families were extinct. The republicans of spirit and ability
had perilhed in the field of battle, or in the proscription. The door
of the affembly had been defignedly left open, for a mixed multi-
tude of more than a thousand persons, who reflected disgrace upon
their rank, instead of deriving honour from 1t²

Augustus laid afide the tyrant, and profeffed himself the father of
his country. He was elected censor3 and, in concert with his
faithful Agrippa, he examined the list of the senators, expelled a
few members, whose vices or whose obstinacy required a public
example, persuaded near two hundred to prevent the lhame of an
expulsion by a voluntary retreat, raised the qualification of a sena-
tor to about ten thousand poundS‚ created a sufficient number of
Patrician samium, and accepted for himself, the honourable title
of Prince of the Senate, which had always been bestowed, by the
censors, on the citizen the most eminent for his honours and services ³.
