‚OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

happiness as the condition of the times was capable of receiving,
Italy and Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant as con-
temptible as he was odious. The zeal of ssattcry and faetion has
indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquissied to
the glory of their successful rivals3 but even those writers who
have revealed‚ with the most freedom and plcasure‚ the faults of
Constantine, unanimoussy confess, that Maxentius was cruel‚ ra-
pacious, and profligate 4². He had the good fortune to suppress
a ssight rebellion in Africa. The governor and a few adherents
had been guilty3 the province suffered for their crime. The
fiourishing cities of Cirtha and Carthage‚ and the whole extent
of that fertile country, were wasted by fire and sword. :I'he abuse
of vietory was followed by the abuse of ’ law and justice. A for-
midable army of sycophants and delators invaded Africa3 the rich
and the noble were easily convicted of a connexion with the
xebe1s3 and those among them who experienced the emperor’s
clemency, were only punished by the confiscation of their estates ⁴³·
So signal a victory was celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and
Maxentius exposed to the eyes of the people the spoils and cap-
tives of a Roman province. The state of the capital was no less
deserving of compaffion than that of Africa. The wealth of Rome
supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expences,
and the ministers of his revenue were {killed in the art's of rapine.
It was under his reign that the method of exafflng a free gfft
from the senators was first invented ; and as the sum was insenlibly
increased, the pretences oflevying it, avietory, a birth, a marriage, or·
an Imperial consulship, were proportionably multiplled *fi Maxentius
