been diffused by conquest, from the confines of Italy to the neigh-

The Goths were now in possession of the Ukrainc, a country of
confidcrable extent and uncommon fertility, intersec‘lcd with navi-

Borysthenes 3 and interspersed with large and lofty foresls of
oaks. The plenty of game and suh, the innumerable bee·hives‚

soil for every species of grain, and the luxuriancy of the vegetation,
all displayed the liberality of Nature, and tempted the industry of
man ²⁸. But the Goths withstood all these temptations, and still ad-

The Scythian hords, which, towards the east, bordered on the new·

boundary of the Roman power, the fortifications of the Lower Da-
