diffused by adoption and female alliance, Nero was the last prince
who could alledge any hereditary claim to the honours of the Julian

line. But, at the time of his death, the praffice of a century had

rinseparably connected those appellations with the Imperial dignsty,

and they have been preserved by a long sueceffion of emperors,
Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the fall of the re—
public to the present time. A distinction was, however, soon intro·
dueed. The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the

to his relations 3 and, from the reign of Hadrian, at least, was ap-
propriated to the second person in the state, who was considered as
the presumptive heir of the empire.

The tender respe& of Augustus for a free constitution which he
had destroyed, can only be explained by an attentive consideration

of the character of that subtle tyrant. A cool head, an unfeeling
heart, and a cowardly disposition, prompted him, at the age of
