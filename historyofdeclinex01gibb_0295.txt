OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the house and family, the management of the land and cattle, were
delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and ssaves. The
lazy warrior, destitute of every art that might employ <his leisure
hours, consumed his (lays and nights in the animal gratifications of
sseep and food. And yet, by a wonderful diversity of Nature, (ac-
cording to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest

receffes), the same barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the
most restless of mankind. They delight in ssoth‚ they detest tran-
quillity ³⁰. The languid foul, oppreffed with its own weight, anxi-
oussy required some new and powerful sensation ; and war and dan-
ger were the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper. The
found that summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear.
It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an adtive

pursuit, and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of‘

the mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence. In
the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately ad-
di&ed to deep gaming and excessive drinking3 both of which, by
different means, the one by inflaming their paffions, the other by
extinguissiing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain of
thinking. They gloried in paffing whole days and nights at table;·
and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous
and drunken assemblies ³¹. Their debts of honour (for in that light
they have transmitted to us those of play) they discharged with
the most romantic fidelity. The desperate gamester, who had staked
his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice, patiently submitted
to the decifion of fortune, and suffered himself to be bound, chas-
used, and sold into remote ssavcry, by his weaker but more lucky
antagonist ³².
