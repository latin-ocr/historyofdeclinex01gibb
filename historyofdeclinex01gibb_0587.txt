OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the
nation. Their. zcal, however, added nothing to its evidence, or
even probability : and it was still necessary, that the doetrine of lise
and immortality‚ which had been dietated by nature, approved by

reason, and received by superstition, should obtain the sanfflon of

divine truth from the authority and example of Christ.

XVhen the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind,
⁵ on condition of adopting the faith and of observing the precepts
of the gospel, it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer should
have been accepted by great numbers of every religion, of every
rank, and of every province in the Roman empire. The ancient
Christians were animated by a contempt for their present existence,
and by a just confidence of immortality, of which the doubtful and
imperfe& faith *of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion.
In the primitive church, the infiuence of truth was very powerfully
strengthened by an opinion, which, however it may deserve respect
for'its usefulness and antiquity‚ has not been found agreeable to
experience. It was universally believed, that the end of the world,
and the kingdom of Heaven‚ were at hand. The near approach
of this wonderful event had been predicted by the apossles; the
tradition of it waspreserved by their earliest disciples, and those
who understood in their literal sense the discourses of Christ himself,

of Man in the clouds, before that generation was totally extin-
guilhed, which had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and
which might still be witness to the calamities of the Jews under
Vespafian or Hadrian. The revolution os seventeen centuries has
instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of
prophecy and revelation3 butas long as, for wife purposes, this error
was permitted to subsist in the chureh, it was productive of the most
salutary effeets on t'ne faith and praetice of Christians, who lived
