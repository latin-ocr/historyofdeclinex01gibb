OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

gress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of C H 3³1).

Christ, his innocent disciples were punilhed with death by the
sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophie cha-
racter, and according to the laws of an emperor, distinguished by
the' wisdom and justice of his general administration. The apo-
logies which were repeatedly addrefl'ed to the succell'ors of Trajan
are filled with the most pathetic complaints, that the Chri-stians
who obeyed the dientes, and solicited the liberty, of conscience, were
alone, among all the subjeers of the Roman empire, excluded from
the common benefits of their auspicions government. The deatha
ofa few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care ; and from
the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme power, the
governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in
displaying the cruelty‚ than in imitating the conclu& of their Pagan
adversaries. To separate (if it be pofflble) a few authentic as well as
interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error, and
to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the canses, the extent, the
duration, and the most important circumstances of the persecutions
to which the first Christians were exposed, is the design of the
present Chapter.

The senaa-ies of a persecuted religion, depreffed by sear, animated
with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are seldorn in
a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to
appreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often escape the im-
partial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure
distance from the flames of persecution. A reason has been assigned
sor the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christiane,
which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn
from the acknowled'ged genius of Polytheism. I't has already been
observed, that the religious concord of the world was principally
supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of
antiquity expreffed for their respective traditions and ceremonics.
