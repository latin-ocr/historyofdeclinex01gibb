which, as it could not discharge itself on the distant senate, threat-
ened the life of his son, of his friends, and of all who ventured
to approach his person. The grateful intelligence of the death
of the Gordians, was quickly followed by the assurance that the
senate, laying afide all hopes of pardon or accommodation, had
substituted in their room two emperors, with whose merit he could
not be unacquainted. Revenge was the only consolation left to
Maximin‚ and revenge could only be obtained by arms. The
strength of the legions had been affembled by Alexander from all
parts of the empire. Three successful campaigns against the
Germans and the Sarmatians, had raised their farne, confirmed their
discipline, and even increased their numbers, by filling the ranks
with the flower of the barbarian youth. The life of Maximin had
been spent in war, and the candid severity of history cannot refuse
him the valour of a soldier, or even the abilities of an experienccd
general ³¹. It might naturally be expeffited, that aprince of such a clia-
raCter, instead ofsuffering the rebellion to gain stability by dehy, should
immediately have marched from the banks of the Danube to those of =
the Tyber, and that his vidtorious army, instigated by contempt for
the senate, and eager to gather the spoils of Italy, should have burned
