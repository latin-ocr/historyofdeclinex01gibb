are told that Galerius, who had formed a very imperfect notion of sav-*a
the greatuess of Rome by the cities of the East, with which he was
acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the slege of that
immense capital. But the extent of a city serves only to render
it more acceffible to the enemy; Rome had long fince been accus-
tomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror3 nor could the
temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended against
the discipline and valour of the legions. We are likewise in-
formed, that the legions themselves were struck with horror and
remorse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to vio-
late the sanclity of their venerable parent ²⁶. But when we recolleet:
with how much ease in the more ancient civil wars, the zeal of
party, and the habits of military obedience, had converted the
native citizens of Rome into her most implacable enemies, we
shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and
barbarians, who had never beheld Italy till they entered it in a ho-
stile manner. Had they not been restrained by motives of a more
interested nature, they would probably have answered Galerius in
the words of Caesar’s veterans: “If our general wishes to lead us
‘⁶ to the banks of the Tyber, we are prepared to trace out his camp.
“ Whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground,
“ our hands are ready to work the engines: nor shall we hesitare,
“ should the name of the devoted city be Rome itself.’' These are
indeed the expreffions of a poet; but of a poet who has been dis-
tinguished and even censured for his stri& adherence to the truth of
history ²⁷.
