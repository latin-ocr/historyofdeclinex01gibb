worthy of his interposition, never exposed his person or reputation
to any unneceffary danger, ensured his success by every means that
prudence could suggest, and displayed, with ostentation‚ the conse·
quences of his vidtory. In wars of a more difficult nature, and
more doubtful event, he employed the rough valour of Maximian,
and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to
the vvise counsels and auspicious influence of his benefadtor. But
after the adoption of the two Caesars, the emperors themselves, re-
tiring to a less laborious scene of aetion, devolved on their adopted
sons the defence of the Danube and of the Rhine. The vigilant
Galerius was never reduced to the neceffity of vanquishing an army
of barbarians on the Roman territory ³⁵. The brave and ailive
Constantius delivered Gaul from a very furious inroad of the
Ale1nanni3 and his vidtories of Langres and Vindoniss'a appear
to have been actions of confiderable danger and merit. As he tra-
versed the open country with a feeble guard, he was cncompalled
on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy. He retreated
with difficulty towards Langres ; but, in the general consternation,
the citizens refused to open their gates, and the wounded prinec
was drawn up the wall by tlie means of a rope. But 011 the
news os his distress, the Roman troops liastened from all lides to
his relies, and before the evening he had satisssed‘his honour and
revenge by the ssaughter of slX thousand Alemanni ²⁶. From the
monuments of those times, the obscure traces of several other vieto-
ries over the barbarians of Sarmatia and Germany might possibly be
colleC‘ted3 but the tedious search would not be awarded either with
amusement or with instruetion.
