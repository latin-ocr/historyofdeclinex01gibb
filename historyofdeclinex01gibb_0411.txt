OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 385

world remained without a sovereign, without an usurper, and with- C {lii P.
outa sedition. The generals and magistrates appointed by Aure- k--w-J
lian continued to execute their ordinary funffions, and it is observed,
that a proconsul of Asia was the only confiderable person removed
srom his office, in the whole course of the interregnum.
An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic‚ is supposed
to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and
charadrer, bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was va-
cant during twelve months, till the elefiion of a Sabine philosopher,
and the public peace was guarded in the same manner, by the union of
the several orders of the state. But, in the time of Numa and Ro-
mulus, the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of the
Patricians; and the balance of freedom was easily preserved in a small -
and virtuous community ³. The decline of the Roman state, far dif-
ferent from its infancy‚ was attended with every circumstance that
could banith from an interregnum the prospe& of obedience and har-
mony; an immense and tumultuous capital, awide extent of empire,
the servile equality of despotism, an army of four hundred thousand
meroenaffies, and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, not-
withstanding all these temptations, the discipline and memory of
Aurelian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops as well as
the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions main-
tained their station on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the Imperial
standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the pro-
vinces. A genereus though transient enthusiasin seemed to ani-
mate the military order3 and we may hope that a serv real pa-
triots cultivated the returning friendlhip of the army and the
senate, as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to its

ancient beauty and vigour.
