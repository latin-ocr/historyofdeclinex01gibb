ally received from the provinces of Asturia, Gallicia‚ and Lusita·

We want both leisu‘re and materials to pursue this curious inquiry
through the many potent states that were annihilated in the Roman
empire. Some notion, however, may be formed of the revenue of
the provinces where confiderable wealth had been deposited by na-
ture, or collected by man, if we observe the severe attention that
was dimeted to the abodes of solitude and sterility. Augustus once
received a petition from the inhabitants of Gyarus, humbly praying ,
that they might be relieved from one—third of their exceffive impo-
fitions. Their whole tax amounted indeed to no more than one
hundred and fifty drachmis, or about five pounds: but Gyarus was
a little issand, or rather a rock, of the AEgean sea, destitute of fresh
water and every neceffary of life, and inhabited only by a few
wretched fishermen ⁹⁵.

From the faint glimmerings of such doubtful and scattered lights,
we should be inclined to believe, 1st, That (with every fair allowance
for the difference of times and circumstances) the general income of
the Roman provinces could seldom amount to less than fifteen or
twenty millions of our money ⁹⁶3 and, 2dly, That so ample a revenue
must have been fully adequate to all the expences of the moderate go-
vernrnent instituted by Augustus, whose court was the modest family
of a private senator, and whose military establissiment was calculated
for the defence of the frontiers‚ without any aspiring views of con·
quest, or any serious apprehension of a foreign invasion.

Notwithstanding the seeming probability of both these conclufions,
the latter of them at least is positively disowned by the language
