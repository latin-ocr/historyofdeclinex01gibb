’ 458 THE DsscmNE ΛΝΒ rALL

C {Il-2· P. and frequent marches ς but whencver the public business allowed them
b--w--d any relaxation, they seem to have retired with pleasure to their fa.-
vourite residences of Nicomedia and Milan. Till Diocletiani, in the

twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his Roman triumph, it is ex-
tremely doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the
empire. - Even on that memor-able occasion his stay did not exceed
two months. Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people‚
he quitted Rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was ex-
pedled that he should have appeared in the senate, invested with the
enfigns of the consular dignity ⁹².
Debasement The dissike expreffed by Diocletian towards Rome and Roman
ss{¹}ff{nese²i¹¹d freedom, was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result
ΜΕ· of the most artful policy. That crafty prince had framed a new
system of Imperial government, which was afterwards 'completed
by the family of Constantine3 and as the image of the old con-
stitution was religioussy preserved in the senate, he resolved to
.. deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration,
· We may recolle& about eight years before the elevation of Diocle- Β
tian, the transient greatness‚ and the ambitious hopes, of tho
Roman senate. As long as that enthufiasm prevailed‚ many of the·
nobles imprudentl3⁷ displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom ς
aud after the succeffors of Probus had withdrawn their countenance
from the republican party, the senators were unable to disguise their
impotent resentment. As the sovereign of Italy, Maximian was-
intrusted with the care of extinguishing this troublesome, rather*
than dangerous, spirit, and the tasi< was perfectly suited to his-
cruel temper. The most illustrious members of the senate, whom.
Diocletian always affected to esteem, were involved, by his col--

1eague, in the accusation of imaginary plots; and the pofl'eflion of

occasion Ammianus mentions the dicacitas car. (See 1. xvi. c-10.)
