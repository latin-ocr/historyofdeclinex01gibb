sickness, he had derived some benefit, either spiritual or physical,
from the holy oil, with which one of his ssaves had anointed him.
He always treated with peculiar distinffion several persons of both
sexes who had embraced the new religion. The nurse as well as
the preceptor of Caracalla were Christians3 and if that young prince
ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity‚ it was occasioned by an in-

Christianity ¹⁰⁸. Under the reign of Severus, the fury of the popu-
lace was checked 3 the rigour of ancient laws was for some time sus-
pended 3 and the provincial governors were satisfied with receiving
an annual present from the churches within their jurisdictiom as the
price, or as the reward, of their moderatiori ¹¹²⁹. The controversy
concerning the precise time of the celebration of Easter armed the

attention, and to have alienated the mind, of Severus. With the
