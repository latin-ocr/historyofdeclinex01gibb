formed an army of Veterans‚ commanded by an able and experienced
leader. Philip was either killed in the battle, or put to death a
few days afterwards at Verona. His son and associate in the em-

his reluctant acceptance of the title of Augustus, he had affui-ed
Philip by a private mess'age, of his innocence and loyalty, solemnly
protesting, that, on his arrival in Italy, he would refign the Imperial
ornaments, and return to the condition of an obedient subjeet.
His profeffions might be sincere. But in the situation where for-
tune had placed him, it was scarcely possible that he could either for-
give or be forgiven ³.

The emperor Decius had employed a few months in the works
of peace and the administration of justice, when he was summoned
to the banks of the Danube by the invasion of the Gorns. This
is the first considerable occaslon in which history mentions that
great people, who afterwards broke the Roman power, sacked the
Capitol, and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy. So memorable was
the part which they affited in the subverfion of the XVestern empire‚
that the name of Go'rfls is frequently but improperly used as a
general appellation of rude and warlike barbarism.

to posterity their own atchievements. The principal minister of the

court of Ravenna, the learned Cassiodorus, gratified the inclination
