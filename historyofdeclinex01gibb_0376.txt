350 THE DECLINE'ANAD FALL

C 214? P. the wealthy capital of all the Macedonian provinces, Their attacks,

μ-Ὗ-ι in which they displayed a fierce but artless bravery, were soon in-
terrupted by the rapid approach of Claudius, hastening to a scene
of aCtion that deserved the presence of a warlike prinee at the head
of the remaining powers of the empire. Impatient for battle, the
Goths immediately broke up their camp, relinquilhed the siege of
Thessalonica, left their navy at the foot of mount Athos, tra-
versed the hills of Macedonia, and preffed forwards to engage the
last defence of Italy.

hero careless of his fate, conscious of his danger, but still deriving
a well-grounded hope from the resources of his own mind.
