THE DECLINE AND FALL

Of the Constitution of the Roman Empire, in the Age of

the Antonines.

HE obvious definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a
state, in which a fingle person, by whatsoever name he may

¹¹¹⁰· be distinguished, is intrusted with the execution of the laws, the

management of the revenue, and the command of the army. But
unless public liberty is protedted by inti-epid and vigilant guardians,
the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon degenerate into
despotism. The influence of the clergy‚ in an age of superstition,
might be usefully employed to affert the rights of mankind3 but so
intimate is the connexion between the throne and the altar, that the
banner of the church has very seldom been seen on the fide of the
people. A martial nobility and stubborn commonS, poffeffed of
arms, tenacious of property, and collected into constitutional assem-
blies‚ form the only balance capable of preserving a free constitution
against enterprises of an aspiring prince.

Every barrier of the Roman constitution had been levelled by the

vast ambition of the di&ator; every fence had been extirpated by
the cruel hand of the Triumvir. After the victory of Actium, the

fate of the Roman vvorld depended on the will of Oetavianuffi sur-

, named Caesar, by his uncle’s adoption, and afterwards Augustus,

by the flattery of the senate. The conqueror was at the head of
forty·four veteran legions ¹, conscious of their own strength, and of
the weakness of the constitution, habituated, during twenty years civil
