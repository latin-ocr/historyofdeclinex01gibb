As the legissative authority of the particular ehurches was insen- Prpgress of
fibly superseded by the use of conflens, the bishops obtained by their afficio& ω’
alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrury power; and
as soon as they were connected by a sense of their common interest,

mand, scattered the seeds of future usurpations, and supplied by
scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force
and of reason. They exalted the unity and power of the ehurch, as
