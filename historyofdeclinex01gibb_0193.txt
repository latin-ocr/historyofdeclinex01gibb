cruel maffacre, the latter as a perfidious one
too. It seems*pr0bab1e‚ that the Alexan-

³⁷ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1284. Mr. 'Wotton
(Hist. of Rome, p. 330.) suspects that this
maxim was invented by Caracalla himself
and attributed to his father.

³³ Dion (l. lxxviii. p. 1343.) informs us
that the ext1·a‹›rdinm·ygift5 of Caracalla to
the army amountei annually to seventy mil-

military pay, infinitely curious3 were it not·
obscure, imperfe8t‚ and probably corrupt.
The best sense seems to be, that the Praete--
rian guards received twelve hundred and
fifty drachmae (forty pounds) a year. (Dion,
1. lxxvii. p. ¹307·) Under [he reign of Aua
gastus, they were paid at the rate of two
drachmae, or denarii, per day, 720 a year
(Tacit. Annal. i. 17.). Domitian, who in-
creased the soldier’s pay one fourth, must
have raised the Przetorians to 960 drachmae
(Gronovius de Pecunia Veteri, l. iii. c. z.).
These successive augmentations ruined the
empire, for with the soldier-²>- pay, their num-
bers too were increased. We have seen the
Praetorians alone increased from 10,000 to
50,000 men.
