656 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual candour and

ι-ΞΥ-ᾎΔ impartiality. A short abstra& therefore of its most important cir-
cumstances will convey the clearest information of the spirit, and of
the forms, of the Roman persecutions ⁸⁰.

A. D. ²57· When Valerian was consul for the third, and Gallienus for the

fflgzttiannh- fourth, time; Paternus, proconsul of Africa, summoned Cyprian

to appear in his private council-chamber. He there acquainted him
with the Imperial mandate which he had just received ⁸¹, that those
who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately return
to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors. Cyprian replied
without hesitation, that he was a Christian and a bishop, devoted to
the worship of the true and only Deity, to whom he offered up his
daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors,
his lawful sovereigns. With modest confidence he pleaded the pri-
vilege of a citizen, in rcfufing to give any answer to some invidious
and indeed illegal questions which the proconsul had proposed. A
sentence of banishment was pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian’s
disobedience; and he was conducted without delay to Curubis, a free
and maritime city of Zeugitania‚ in a pleasant situation, a fertile

territory, and at the distance of about forty miles from Carthage ⁸².

²³0 We have an original life of Cyprian by
the deacon Pontius, the companion of his
exile, and the speftator of his death; and
we likewise poss'ess the ancient proconsular
asts of his martyrdom. These two relations
are consistent with each other, and with pro-
bability; and what is somewhat remarkable,
they are both unsullied by any miraculous cir-
cumstances.

Μ It should seem that these uere circular
orders, sent at the same time to all the go-
vernor-5. Dtnnyfius (ap. Enseb. l. vii. c. 11.)
rclztcs the history of hij own baniihment srom
Alexandria, almost in the same manner. But
as he escnped and {mvii-cd the persecuntur,
we must account him either more or less for-

tunate than Cyprian.

δὲ See Plin. Hist. Natur. v. 3. cellarius,
Geograph. Antiq. part iii. p. 96. Shaw's
Travels, p. 90.; and for the adjacent coun-
try (which is terminated by Cape Bona, ox·
the promontory of Mercury) l’Afrique de
Marmol. tom. ii. p. 474. There are the re-
mains of an aquedueh near Curubis, or Cur-
bis, at present altered into Gurbes; and Dr.
Shaw read an inscription, which styles that
city, Colonia Fulvia. The deacon Pontii-ss
(in Vit. Cyprian. c. 12.) calls it “ Apricum
et competentem locum, hospitium pro volun-
tate secretum, ct quicquid apponi eis ante
promissum est, qui regnum et justitiam Dei
quaerunt.”
