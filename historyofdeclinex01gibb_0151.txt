OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

a rath youth ⁵⁴, but of an ancient and opulent family, listened to the
voice of axnbiti0n3 and a con'spiracy was formed during a short
absence of Pertinax, which was crushed by his sudden return to
Rome, and his resolute behaviour. Falco was on the point of be-
ing justly condemned to death, as a public enemy, had he not been
saved by the earnest and sincere intreaties of the injured emperor;
who conjured the senate, that the purity of his reign might not be
” stained by the blood even of a guilty senator.

These disappointments served only to irritate the tage of the Prae-
torian guards. On the twenty-eighth of March, eighty-six days
only after the death of Commodus, a general sedition broke out in
the camp, which the officers wanted either power or inclination to
suppress. Two or three hundred of the most desperate soldiers march-
ed at noon-day, with arms in their hands, and fury in their looks, to-
wards the Imperial palace. The gates were thrown open by their
companions upon guard3 and by the domestics of the old court,
who had already formed a secret conspiracy against the life of the
too virtuous emperor. On the news of their approach, Pertinax
disdaining either ssight or concealment advanced to meet his affaffin53
and recalled to their minds his own innooence, and the sanetity of
'their recent oath. For a few moments they stood in silent suspense,
ashamed of their atrocious design, and awed by the venerable aspect
and majestic firmness of their sovereign, till at length the despair
of pardon re‘viving their fury, a barbarian of the country of Tongres ⁵³
levelled the first blow against Pertinax, who was instantly dispatched
