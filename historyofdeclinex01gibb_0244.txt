THE DECLINE AND FALL

discipline the Italian youth3 and instructed to fortify the ports and
highways, against the impending invasion of Maximin. A number
of deputies, chosen from the most illustrious of the senatorian and
equestrian orders, were dispatehed at the same time to the governor
of the several provinces, earnestly conjuring thern to sly to the
assistance of their country, and to remind the nations of their
ancient ties of friendship with the Roman senate and people. The
general respe& with which these deputies were received, and the
zeal of Italy and the provinces in favour of the senate, sufficiently
prove that the subjectis of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon
distress, in which the body of the people has more to fear from
oppreflion than from refistance. The consciousness of that melan·-
choly trutli, inspires a degree of persevering fury, seldorn to be
found in those civil wars which are artificially supported for the be-
nefit of a few factious and designing leaders ²⁵.

But while the cause of the Gordians was embraced with such
diffufive ardour, the Gordians themselves were no more. The
feeble court of Carthage was alarmed with the rapid approach of
Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a small band of
Veterans, and a fierce host of barbarians, attacked a faithful, but
unwarlike province. The younger Gordian sallied out to meet the
enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous undisciplincd
multitude, educated in the peaceful luxury of Carthage. His use-
less valour served only to procure him an honourable death, in the
field of battle. His aged father, whose reign had not exceeded
thirty-six days, put an end to his life on the first news of the de-
feat. Carthage, destitute of defence, opened her gates to the con-
queror, and Africa was exposed to the rapacious cruclty of a ssave,

obliged to satisfy his unrelenting master with a large account of
blood and treasure ²⁶.
