THE ‘DECLINE 'AND FA'LL

Every mode of torture was put in practice, and the court, as weti

as city, was polluted with many bloody executionsffi. But as it
was found impoflible to extort any discovery of this mysterious

t‘ransafflon‚ it seems incumbent on us either to presume the inno-

-cence, or to admire the resolution, of the sufferers. A few days after-
-wards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia, declaring‚

,that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace, he ssiould
fall a sacrifice to the rage of the Christians. The ecclefiastical his-
torians, from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect know-
ledge of this persecution‚ are at a loss how to account for the fears
and danger of the emperors· Two of these writers, a Prince and a
Rhetorician‚ were eye-witnefl‘es of the fire of Nicomedia. The one
ascribes it to lightning, and the divine wrath3 the other affirms, that
it was kindled by the inalice of Galerius himself¹⁵⁶.

As the edicts against the Christians was defigned for a general law
of the whole empire, and as Diocletian and Galerius, though theyf
might not wait for the consent, were affured of the concurrence, ’
of ‘the western princes, it would appear more consonant to our ideas
of policy‚' that the governors of all the provinces should have
received secret instructions to publish, on one and the same day,
this declaration of war within their respective departments. It
was at least to be expected, that the convenience of the public high-
ways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to
rransmit their orders with the utmost dispatch from the palace of Nico-
media to the extremities of the Roman world; and that they would
not have suffered fifty days to elapse, before the edi& was published
