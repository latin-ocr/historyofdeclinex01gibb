were cmbellifhed by the same liberal spirit of public magnificemur,
and were filled with amphitheatres, theatres‚ temples, porticos, tri-
umphal arches, baths, and aquedu&s‚ all variously conducive to
the heahh, the devotion, and the pleasures of the meanest citizen.
The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention.
The boldness of the enterprise, the solidity of the execution, and the
uses to which they were subservient, rank the aqueducts among the
noblest monuments of Roman genius and power. The aqueduCtS of
the capital claim a just pre-eminence; but the curious traveller‚
who, without the light of history, should examine those of Spoleto‚
of Metz‚ or of Segovia, would very naturally conclude, that those
provincial towns had formerly been the refidence of some potent
monarch. The solitudes of Afia and Africa were once covered
with flourishing cities, whose populousness‚ and even whose ex·
istenee, was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial
stream of fresh water ⁷³.

We have computed the inhabitants, and contemplated the public
works, of the Roman empire. The observation of the number and
greatness of its eities will serve to confirm the former, and to multiply
the latter. It may not be unpleasing to colle& a few scattered instances
relative to that subjeffit, without forgetting, however, that from the

vanity of nations and the poverty of language, the vague appellation
of city has been indifferently bestowed on Rome and upon Lau-
rentum. Ancient Italy is said to have contained eleven hundred
and ninety-seven citie53 and for whatsoever aera of antiquity
