THE DECLINE AND FALL

the proportion between gold and filver, as it stood in the time of
Pliny, and as it was fixed in the reign of Constantine, we shall dis-
cover within that period a very considerable increase ¹⁰²³. There
is not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce;
it is therefore evident that filver was grown more common; that
whatever might be the amount of the Indian and Arabiam exports‚
they were far from exhausting the wealth of the Roman world;
and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the demands
of commerce.

Notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to exalt the past,
and to depreciate the present, the tranquil and prosperous state of
the empire was warmly felt, and honestly confeffed‚ by the pro-
vincials as well as Romans. “ They acknowledged that the true
“ principles of social life, laws, agriculture, and science, which had
“ been first invented by the wisdom of Athens, were now firmly
“ establissied by the power of Rome, unde'r whose auspicious
“ influence, the fiereest barbarians were united by an equal govern-
“ ment and common language. They affirm, that with the im-
“ provement of arts, the human species was visibly multiplied.
“ They celebrate the increafing splendour of the cities, the beau-
“ tiful face of the country, cultivated and adorned like an im-
“ mense garden; and the long festival of peaee, which was en·
“ joyed by so many nadons, forgetful of their ancient animofities‚
“ and delivered from the apprehension of future danger¹⁰⁹‚’'
XV'natever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and
declamation‚ which seems to prevail in these passages, the substance
of them is perfeffly agreeable to historic truth.
