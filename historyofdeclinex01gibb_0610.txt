care. In proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful,
a larger or smaller number of these episcopal prefhyters guided

each infant congregation with equal authority, and with united

But the most perfect equality of freedom requires the direffing
hand of a superior magistrate3 and the order of public deliberatious
soon introduces the office of a president, invested at least with the
authority of collecting the sentiments‚ and of executing the re-
solutions, of the affembly. A regard for the public tranquillity,
which would so frequently have been interrupted by annual or by
occafional electione, induced the primitive Christians to constitute an

honourable and perpetual magistracy, and to choose one of the wisest
and most holy among their presbyters to execute, during his life, the
duties of their ecelefiastical governor. It was under these circum-

humble appellation of presbyter ; and while the latter remained the
most natural distinction for the members of every Christian senate,
the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president ¹⁰⁹.

yet the epistle of Clemens (which is proba-

discover any traces of episcopacy either at Co-
rinth or Rome.
