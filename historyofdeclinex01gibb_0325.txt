and the Danube without encountering any oppofition capable of
retarding his progress. The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops
betrayed the most important posts, where they vvere stationed, and the

sear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to

inlist under the Gothic standard. The various multitude of barba-

rians appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a

city built by Trajan in honour of his fister, and at that time the
capital of the second Maefia ²⁹. The inhabitants consented to ran-

of Maefia, whilst the main body of the army, consisting of seventy

atchievements, required the presence of the Roman monarch, and

the exertion of his military power.
