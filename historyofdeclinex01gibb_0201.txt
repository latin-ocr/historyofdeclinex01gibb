or THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 175

of Antioch, to meet the increasmg and zealous army of the you'ng C ἙξῘΙΑ P·
pretendcr. His own troops seemed to take the field with faintness ῑ--ψ--ι
and reluC'cance5 but, inv the heat of the battle ⁴⁹, the Praetorian guardS‚ A. D. 218.
almost by an ›involuntary impulse, asserted the superiority of their ’μὴ June
valour and> discipline. The rebel ranks were broken3 when the
mother and grandmother of the Syrian prime, who, according to their
eastern custom, had attended the army, threw themselves from their
covered chax-ion, and, by exciting the compaffion of the soldiers, en· ·
deavoured' to animate their dr'ooping courage. Antoninus himself,
who in the rest of his life never atsted like a man, in this-important
crisis of his-fate approved himself a hero, mounted his horse, and
at the head of his rallied troops charged sword in hand among the
thickest of the enemy3' whilst the eunuch Gannys, whose occupations
had been confined to female cares and the soft luxury of Asia,
displayed the talents of an able and experienced general. The
battle still raged with doubtful ¹violence, and Macrinus might have
obtained the νίἑῖοτγ, had he not betrayed his own cause by a {hame-
ful and precipitate· ssight. His cowardice served only to protra&
his life a few days, and to ssamp deserved ignominy on his mis-
fortunes. It is scarcely necessary to add, that his fon Diadume-
nianus was involved in the same fate. As soon as the stubborn
Praetorians could be convinced that¹they fought for a prince who had
basely deserted them, they surrendered to the conqueror3 the cona
tending parties of the Roman army mingling tears of joy and teu-r
derness, united under the banners of the imagined son of Caracalla„
and the East acknowledg'ed with pleasure the first emperor of Asiatic
extrafifion. ’ ·
