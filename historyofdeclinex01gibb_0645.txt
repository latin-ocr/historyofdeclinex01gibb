event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the curiofity‚ and C {¹46¹ Ρ·
the devotion of mankind, passed without notice in an age of seience ι--Ν
and history '⁹⁶- It happened during the lifetime of Seneca and the
elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effec'ts, or
received the earliest intelligence‚ of the prodigy. Eaeh of these phi-
losophers‚ in a laborious work, has recorded all the great pheno-
mena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors‚ comets, and eclipses, which
his indefatigable curiosity could colle& ¹⁹⁷. Both the one and the
other have omitted to mention the greatest phenornenon to which the
mortal eye has been witness smee the creation of the globe. A dis-
tin& chapter of Pliny ¹⁹⁸ is defigned for eclipses of an extraordinary
nature and unusual duration; but he contents himself with de-
scribing the singular dese& of light which followed the murder of
Caesar, when, during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun
appeared pale and without splendour. This season of obsnurity3
which cannot surely be compared with the praeternatu'ral darkness of
the Paffion, had been already celebrated by most of the poets ¹⁹⁹ and

historians of that memorable age ²⁰⁰.
