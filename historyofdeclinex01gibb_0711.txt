OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

be true that he was a person of rank and education, those circum-
ssances could serve only to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or
rather roasted, by a ssow s1re3 and his executionem, zcalous to re-
vengc the personal insultwhieh had been offered to the emperors,
exhausted every refinement of cruelty, without being able to subdue
his patience, or to alter the steady and insulting smile which in his
dying agonies he still preserved in his countenance. The Christians,
though they confeffed that his coudu& had not bcen strictly con-
formable to the laws of prudence, admired the divine fervour of his
zeal; and the exceffive commendatioris which they lavissied on the
mernory of their hero and martyr, contributed to fix a deep im·-
preffion of terror and hatred in the mind of Diocletian ¹⁵4.

His fears were soon alai-med by the view of a danger from which
he very narrowly escaped. Within fifteen days the palaee of Nico-
media, and* even the bedchamber of Diocletian, were twice in flames ;
and though both times they were extinguilhed without any material
damage, the singular repetition of the fire was justly confidered as
an evident proof that it had not been the effe& of chance or ne-
gligence. The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians; and it
was suggested, with some degree of probability, that those despe-
rate fanatics, provoked by their present sufferings, and apprehensive
of impending calamities‚ had entered into a conspiracy with their
faithful brethren, the eunucha of the palace‚ against the lives of
two emperors, whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of
the church of God. Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every
breast, but especially in that of Diocletian. A great number of
persons, distinguiss1ed either by the offices which they had filled,
or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were thrown into prison.
