the subje& not only of literary but of national disputes.

Notwith-

standing the recent tradition, which affigns for her father, a
British king, we are obliged to confess, that Helena was the
daughter of an innkeeper ⁸3 but at the same time we may defend
the legality of her marriage, against those who have represented her

as the concubine of Constantius ⁹.

The great Constantine was most

probably born at Naissus, in Dacia ¹⁰, and it is not surprffing,
that in a family and province distinguished only by the profession of

⁸ This tradition, unknown to the contem-
poraries of Constantine, was invented in the
darkness of monario-ies, was embellished by
Jefstey of Monmouth‚ and the writers of the
aiith century, has been defended by our anti-
quarians of the last age, and is serioussy re-
lated in the ponderous history of England,
compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He
transports‚ however, the kingdom of Coil,
the imaginary father of Helena, from Effex
to the wall of Antoninus.

9 Eutropius (x. 2.) expresse5‚ in a few
words, the real truth‚ and the occafion of the
error, “ ex obscuriori matrimonio ejus filius.''
Zosimus (l. ii. p. 78.) eagerly seized the most
unfavourable report, and is followed by Oro-
sius (vii. 25.)‚ whose authority is oddly enough
overlooked by the indefatigable but partial
Tillemont. By insisting on the divorce of
Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her mar-
ritlge.

’θ There are three opinions with regard to
the place of Constantine’s birth. 1. Our
English antiquar-ianr, were used to dwell with
rapture on the words of his panegyrist;
⁴‘ Britannias illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.”
Eut tbi> celebrated passage may be referred
with :ts much propriety to the accession as to

⁷ arms, the youth {hould discover very little inclination to improve his

the nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the
modern Greeks have ascribed the honour of
his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulf
of Nicomedia (Celbzrius, torn. ii. p. 174.),
which Constantine dignified with the name of
Helenopolis, and Justinian adorned with ma-
ny splendid buildings (Procop. de AEdificiis,
v. 2.). It is indeed probable enough that
Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum;
and that Constantius might lodge there when.
he returned from a Persian embafl'y in the
reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering
life of a soldier, the place of his marriage,
and the places where his children are born,
have very little connection with each other.
3. The claim of Naissus is supported by the
anonymous writer, published at the* end of
Ammianus, p. 710, and who in general co·
pied very good materials ; and it is confirmed
by Julius Firmicius (de Astrologii, l. 1.
c. 4.), who flourished under the reign of Con-
stantine himself. Some objefflons have been
raised against the integrity of the text, and
the application of the pass'age of Fi1·micius;
but the former is established by the best MSS.
and the latter is very ably defended by Lip—
sius de Magnitudine Romana, l. iv. c. 11. et
supplement.
