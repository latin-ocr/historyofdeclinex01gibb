legions, though disordered and dismayed by thc unexpected trea- k--v--d
cliery of their chief, defended themselves with a desperate mlour,
.till they were cut in pieces almost to a man, in this bloody and me-
morable battle, which was fought near Chalons in Champag11c50.
The retreat of the irregular auxiliaries, Franks and Batavians ⁵¹,
whom the conqueror soon compelled or persuaded to repass the Rhine,
restored the general tranquillity, and the power of Aurelian was
acknowledged from‘ the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Her·
cules.
As early as the reign of Claudius, the city of Autun, alone and
unassisted, had ventured to declare against the legions of Gaul.
After a fiege of seven months, they stormed and plundered that
unfortunate city, already wasted by famine ⁵². Lyons, on the con-
trary, had resisted with obstinate disaffthion the arms of Aurelian.
We read of the punishment of Lyons ⁵³, but there is not any men-
tion of the rewards of Autun. Such, indeed, is the policy of civil
war3 severely to remember injuries, and to forget the most import-
ant services. Revenge is profitable, gratitude is expenfive.

of Palmyra and the East. Modern Europe has produced several
