THE DECLINE AND FALL

ediCt, to the whole body of Christians‚ who were exposed to a vio-
lent and general persecution ¹⁶⁵. Instead of those salutary restraints,
which had required the dire& and solemn testimony of an accuser,
it became the duty as well as interest of the Imperial officers, to
discover, to pursue, and to torment, the most obnoxious among the
faithful. Heavy penalties were denounced against all who ss10uld
presume to save a proscribed sectary from the just indignation of

the gods, and of the emperorS. Yet, notwithstanding the severity of
this law, the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans, in concealing
their friends or relations, affords an honourable proof, that the

rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the senti-
ments of nature and humanity ¹⁶4.

Diocletian had no sooner published his ediC'cs against the Christ-
ians, than, as if he had been desirous of committing to other
hands the work of persecution‚ he divested himself¹ of the Imperial
purple. The character and situation of his colleagues and succeffors
sometimes urged them to enforce‚ and sometimes inclined them
to suspend, the execution of these rigorous Iaws; nor can we ac-
quire a just and distin& idea of this important period of eccle·-
siastical history, unless we separately consider the state of Christ-
ianity, in the different parts of the empire, during the space of
ten years, which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian, and
the final peace of the church.

The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the
oppreffion os any part of his subjeets. The principal offices of his
palace were exercised by Christians. He lov ed-their person-5, esteemed
their fidelity‚ and entertained not any dissilze to their religious prin-
ciples. But as long as Constantius re1na.ned in the subordinate
