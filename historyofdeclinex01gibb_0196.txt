of the senate,

THE DECLINE AND FALL

the authority of a distant and fecble senate was little regarded) hung
in anxious suspence; as no candidate presented himself whose distin-
guilhed birth and merit could engage their attachment and unite
their suffrages. The decifive weight of the Praetorian guards ele-
vated the hopes of their praefeCiS, and these powerful ministers be-
gan to affert their legal claim to fill the vacancy of the Imperial
throne. Adventus, however, the senior praesedi, conscious of his
age and infirmhies, of his small reputation, and his smaller abili-
ties, resigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his
colleague Macrinus, whose well—diffembled grief removed all sus-
picion of his being accessary to his master's death ⁴¹. The troops
neither loved nor esteemed his charadier. They cast their eyes
around in search of a competitor, and at last yielded with reluctance
to his promises of unbounded liberality and indulgence. A short
time after his accession, he conferred on his son Diadumenianus, at
the age of only ten years, the Imperial title and the popular name
of Antoninus. The· beautiful figure of the youth, affisted by an
additional donative, for which the ceremony furnished a pretext‚
might attra&, it was hoped, the favour of the army, and secure the
doubtful throne of Macrinus.

The authority ofthe new sovereign had been ratified by the cheerful
submission of the senate and provinces. They exulted in their unex-
pe6³oed deliverance from a hated tyram, and it seemed of little conse-
quence to examine into the virtues of the successor of Caracalla. But
as soon as the first transports of joy and surprise hadsubfided, they
began to scrutinize the merits of Macrinus with a'critical severity,
and to arraign the hasty choice of the army. It had hitherto been·
considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitution, that the
emperor must be always chosen in the senate, and the sovereign
power, no longer exereised by the whole body, was always delegated
