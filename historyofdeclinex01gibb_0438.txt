THE DECLINE AND FALL·

before they were c011tradieted by his death3 an event attended with
such ambiguous circumstances, that it may best be related in a
letter from his own secretary to the praefc& of the city. ‘⁶ Carus‚'’
says he, “ our dearest emperor, was confincd by fickness to his bed,

late emperor's death, it was found impossible to remove the opinion
of the multitude, and the power of opinion is irresistible. Places or
persons struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with ν
