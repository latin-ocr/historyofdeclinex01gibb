emperor had fille'd too'important a character in the World‚ to enjoy
without allay the comfortsand security of a private condition.
It vvas impoffible ‘that he could remain ignorant of the troubles
which afflifted ,the empire after his abdication. .1t was impossible
that he could be indifferent to their consequences. Fcar, sorrow, and
discontent, sometimes pursued him into the solitude of Salona.
His tendernesS‚ or at least his pride, was deeply wounded by the
misfortunes ofhis wife and ‘daughter-3 and the last momentsof
Diocletian were embittered by some affronts, which Licinius and
Constantine might have spared the father of so many emperors, and
the first author of their own fortune. A report‚ though of a yery
doubtful nature, hasxreached our times, that he prudently withdrew
himself from-their povver- by a voluntary death ¹¹4.

Before we dismiss the consideration of the life* and character of
Diocletian, we may, for a moment, dire& our view to the place of
his retirement. Salona, a principal city of his native province of
Dalmatia, was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the
measurernent of the public highways) from Aquileia and the con-
fines of Italy, and· about two hundred and seventy from Sirmium,
the usual refidence of the emperors, whenever they visited the
Illyrian frontier ¹¹⁵. A miserable village still preserves the name of
Salona, but so late as the fixteenth century, the remains of a theatre,
and a confused prospe& of broken arches and marble columns, con-

tinued to attest its ancient splendour¹¹⁶. About fix or seven miles
