THE DECLINE AND FALL

Such was the mild and equal constitution by which the Christians
were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the
apossles. Every society formed within itself a separate and inde-
pendent republic: and although the most distant of these little states
maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and
deputatione, the Christian world was not yet connected by any su-

faithful were gradually multiplied‚ they discovered the advantages
that might result from a closer union of their interest and designa}

and Asia adopted the useful institutions of provincial synoda
and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a
representative council from the celebrated examples of their own
country, the Amphictyons, the Aehaean league‚ or the affemblies of

'the Ionian cities. It was soon establilhed as a custom and as a laW,

that the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the
capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and autumn.
Their deliberations were affisted by the advice ofa few distinguiffied
presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a listening multi-

important controversy of faith and discipline3 and it was natural
to believe that a liberal effufion of the holy spirit would be poured
