562 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HA Γ· all the various race of mankind, should tremble at the appearance

Rsgssffiffcgf The ancient and popular doetrine of the Millennium was inti-
hium-

mately connected with the second coming of Christ. As the works
of the creation had been finished in slX days, their duration in their
present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the
prophet Elijah, was fixed to six thousand years ⁶¹. By the same
analogy it was inferred, that this long period of labour and con-
temon, which was now almost elapsed ⁶², would be succeeded by a
joyful Sabbath of a thousand year53 and that Christ, with the tri-
umphant band of the saints and the 6168( who had escaped death, or
who had been miraculoussy revived, would reign upon earth till the
time appointed for the last and general resurrection. So pleasing
was this hope to the mind of believers, that the New Jerastzlem, the
seat of this blissful kingdom, was quickly adorned with all the
gayest colours of the imagination. A felicity consisting =only of
pure and spiritual pleasure‚ would have appeared too relined for its

inhabitants, who were still supposed to possess their human nature
and senseS. A gai-den of Eden, with the amusements of the pastoral
life, was no longer suited to the advanced state of society which

prevailed under the Roman empire. A city was therefore ereaed

⁶0 This expectation was countcnanced by
the twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew,
and by the first epistle of St. Paul to the
Thess'alonians. Erasmus removes the dif-
ficulty by the help of allegory and metaphor ;
and the learned Grotius ventures to insinuate,
that, for wife purposeS, the pious deception
was permitted to take place.

puted almost 6000 years from the creation of'
the world to the birth of Christ. Africanus,
Laftantius, and the Greek chun-h, hare 16-
duced that number to 5500, aud Eusebius has
contented himself with 5²00 years. These
calculations were formed on the Septuagiut,
which was universally received during the
fix first centuries. The authority of the Vul-
gate and os the Hebrew text has determined
the moderm, protestants as well as Cathol'rcs,
to prefer a period ofabout 4000 years; though,
in the study of profane amiquiry, they often
find themselves streightened by those :rarrow
