coasted round Spain and Gaul, and steering their triumphant course

through the Eritish channel, at length finiffied their surprifing
voyage, by landing in safety on the Batavian or Frisian shores ⁵⁰.
The example of their success, instru&ing their countrymen to con-
ceive the advantages, and to despise the dangers, of the sea, pointed
out to their enterprising spirit, a new road to wealth and glory.
Notwithstanding the vigilance and aCrivity of Probus, it was almost
impoffible that he could at once contain in obedience every part of his
wide extended dominions. The barbarians who broke their chains,
had seized the favourable opportunity of a domestic war. When
the emperor marched to the relies of Gaul, he devolved the com-
mand of the East, on Saturninus. That general, a man of merit:
and experience, was driven into rebellion by the absence of his so-
vereign‚ the levity of the Alexandrian people‚ the preffing in-
stances of his friends, and his own fear53 but from the moment of
his elevation, he never entertained a hope of empire, or even of
life. “ Alas!'’ he said, “the republic has lost a useful servant,
“ and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the services of many
“ years. Yon know n0t‚‘’ continued he, “ the misery of sovereign
“ power3 a sword is perpetually suspended over our head. We
“ dread our very guarda, we distrust our companions. The choice
“ of aetion or of repose is no longer in our disposition, nor is there
“ any age, or character, or contiuo, that can prote& us from the cen-
“ sure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne, you have
‘⁴ doorned me to a life of careS, and to an untimely fate. The only
“ consolation which remains is, the affurance that I shall not fall
“ alone ⁵'.’' But as the former part of his predistion was verisied‘
by the vietory, so the latter was disappointed by the clemency
