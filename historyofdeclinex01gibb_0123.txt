OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

These gloomy apprehenfions had been already justified by the ex-
perience of the Romans. The annals ofthe emperors exhibit a strong
and various picture of human nature, which we should vainly seck
among the mixed and doubtful characters of modern history. ln the
conduct of those monarchs we may trace the utmost lines of vice and
virtue3 the most exalted perfectiom and the meanest degeneracy of
our own species. The golden age of Trajan and the Antonines had
been preceded by an age of iron. It is almost superfluous to enu-
merate the unworthy succeffors of Augustus. Their unparalleled
vices, and the splendid theatre on which they were acted, have saved
them from oblivion. The dark unrelenting Tiberius, the furious
Caligula, the feeble Claudius, the profligate and cruel Nero, the
beastly Vitellius ³⁰, and the timid inhuman Domitian, are condemned
to everlasting infamy. During fourseore years (excepting only the
ssiort and doubtful respite of Vespafian’s reign⁵¹) Rome groaned
beneath an uni-emitting tyranny, which exterminated the ancient
families of the republiC, and was fatal to almost every virtue, and
every taient, that arose in that unhappy period.

Under the reign of these monsters, the ssavery of the Romans
was accompanied with two peculiar circumstances, the one oc·-
casioned by their former liberty, the other by their extensive con-
quests, which rendered their condition more completely wretched
than that of the νίξὶίιῃε of tyranny in any other age or country.
From these causes were derived, 1. The exquisite senlibility of the
