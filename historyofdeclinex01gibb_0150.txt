Such an uniform conduCt had already securcd to Pertinax the
noblest reward of a sovereign, the love and esseem of his people.
Those who remembered the virtues of Marcus were happy to con-

expected from the years and experience of Pertinax, proved fatal to
himself and to his country. His honest indiscretion united against
him the servile crowd, who found their private benefit in the pub-
lic disorders‚ and who preferred the favour of a tyrant to the inex-

Praetorian guards betrayed their inward diffatisfaetion. They had
reluctantly submitted to Pertinax ; they dreaded the strietness of the
ancient discipline, which he was preparing to restore3 and they re-
