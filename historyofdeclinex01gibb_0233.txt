OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

-the least appearance of fatigue, in a long and rapid career. “ Thra-
‘⁴ cian,'’ said Severus, with astonishment, “ art thou disposed to
“ wrestle after thy race ?'' Most willingly, Sir, replied the un-
wearied youth, and, almost in a breath, overthrew seven of the
strongest soldiers in the army. A gold collar was the prize of
his matehless vigour and aCtivity‚ and he was immediately ap-
pointed to serve in the horse-guards who always attended on the

person of the sovereign ².
Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories

of the empire, descended from a mixed race of barbarians. His
father was a Goth, and his mother, of the nation of the Alani.
He displayed, on every occasion, a valour equal to his strength;
and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the
knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his son,
he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favour and esteem
of both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge
of merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the affaffin of
Caracalla. Honour taught him to decline the effeminate insults of
Elagabalus. On the acceflion of Alexander he returned to court,
and was placed by that prince, in a station usqful to the service,
and honourable to himself. The fourth legion, to which he was
appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best disciplined
of the whole army. With the general applause of the soldiers,
who bestowed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and
Hercules, he was succeffively promoted to the first military com-
mand ³, and had not he still retained too much of his savage origin,
the emperor might perhaps have given his own lister in marriage to
the son of Maximin ⁴.
