an army of Germans into Gaul, prevailed on the powerful cities of
Trevcs and Langres to embrace his cause, defeated the legions,
destroyed their fortified camps, and employed against’the Romans
the military knowledge which he had acquired in their service.
XVhen at length, aster an obstinate struggle, he yielded to the power
of the empire, Civilis securcd himself and his country by an ho-
nourable treaty. The Batavians still continued to occupy the islands
ofthe Rhine ⁷⁶, the allies not the servants ofthe Roman monarchy.
II. The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable‚ when we
consider the effects that might have been produced by its united
effort. The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a
million of warriors, as all who were of an age to bear arms, were
of a temper to use them. But this fierce multitude, incapable of

concerting or executing any plan of national greatness‚ was agi-
tated by various and often hostile intentions. Germany was divided

into more than forty independent states; and even in each state the
union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious.
The barbarians vvere easily provoked; they knew not how to for-
give an injury, much less an insult3 their resentments were bloody
and implacable. The casual disputes that so frequently happened
in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking, were sufficient
to inflame the minds of whole nations5 the private feud of any
considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and al-
lies. To chastise the insolent‚ or to plunder the defenceless, were
alike causes of war. The most formidable states of Germany af-
fected to encompass their territories with a wide frontier of solitude
and devastation. The awful distance preserved by their neighbours,
attested the terror of their πῶς, and in some measure defended them
from the danger of unexpcffiled incurfions ⁷⁷.
