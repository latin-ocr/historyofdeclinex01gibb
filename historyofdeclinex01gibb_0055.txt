oF THE ROMAN EMpiRE. 29

from the mountains of Haemus and Rhodope, to the Bosphorus and C HLA P.
the Hellespont, had affumed the form of a province. Notvvith- k-WJ
standing the change of masters and of religion, the new city of
Rome, founded by Constantine on the banks of the Bosphorus,
has ever since remained the capital of a great monarchy. The
kingdom of Macedonia, which, under the reign of Alexander,
gave laws to Asia, derived more solid advantages from the policy
of the two Philips; and with its dependencies of Epirus and
Thessaly, extended from the AEgean to the Ionian sea. XVhen
we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos, of Sparta and Athens,
we can scarcely persuade ourselves, that so many immortal repub-
lics of ancient Greece, were lost in a single province of the Roman
empire, which, from the superior influence of the Achaean league,

was usually denominated the province of Achaia.
Such was the state of Europe under the Roman emperors. The AfiaMinor,

provinces of Asia, without excepting the transient conquests of
Trajan, are all comprehended within the limits of the Turkish
power. But instead of following the arbitrary divisions ofdespotism
and ignorance, it will be safer for us, as well as more agreeable,

confined between the Euxine and the Mediterranean, advances from
the Euphrates towards Europe. The most extensive and flourishing
district, westward of mount Taurus and the river Halys, was dig-
nified by the Romans with the exclusive title of Asia. The juris-
diciion of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of
Troy, Lydia, and Phrygia, the maritime countries of the Pamphy-
lians, Lycians, and Carians, and the Grecian colonies of Ionia,
which equalled in ans, though vnot in arms, the glory of their pa⁸⁵
rent. The kingdoms of Bithynia and Pontus pofl'efl'ed the northern
fide of the peninsula from Constantinople to Trebizond. On the

opposite side, the province of Cilicia was terminated by the moun-
