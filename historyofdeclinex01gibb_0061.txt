OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

by the philosopher, as equally false3 and by the magistrate, as
equally useful. And thus toleration produced not only mutual
indulgence, but even religious concord.

The superstition of the people was not embittered by any mixture
of theologieal rancour; nor was it confined by the chains of any
speculative system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached
to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different reli-

allowed that fages and heroes, who had lived, or who had died for
the benefit of their country, were exalted to a state of power and im-
mortality‚ it was universally confessed, that they deserved, if not
the adoration‚ at· least the reverence, of all mankind. The deities of
a thousand groves and a thousand streams possessed, in peace, their
local and respective influence; nor could the Roman who depre-

of Nature, the planets, and the elements‚ were the same throughout
the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were in-
evitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every
virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine representative; every art
