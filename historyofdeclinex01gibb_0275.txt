the political influence of the Magian with that of the Mahornetan k-v—-J
religion, we shall probably infer, that the kingdom of Artaxerxes
contained at least as great a number of eines, villages‚ and inhabit-
ants. But it must likevvise be confess'ed‚ that in every age the
want of harbours on the sea-coast, and the sear-city of fresh water
in the inland provinces, have been very unfavourable to the com-
merce and agriculture of the Perfians3 who, in the calculation of
their numbers, seem to have indulged one of the meanest, though
most common artifices, of national vanity.
As soon as the ambitious mind of Artaxerxes had triumphed over Recapitula-

the resistanee of his vaffals, he began to threaten the neighbouring {¹2¹ss ξξῃὶιὲῖη

wild Scythians and the effeminate Indians; but the Romans were
an enemy, whr), by their past injuries and present power, deserved
the utmost efforts of his arms. A forty years tranquillity, the
fruit of valour and moderatiori, had sueceeded the victories of Trajan.
During the period that elapsed from the acceffion of Marcus to the
reign of Alexander, the Roman and the Parthian empires were twice
engaged in war; and although the whole strength of the Arsacides
contended with a part only of the forces of Rome, the event was
most commonly in favour of the latter. Macrinus, indeed, prompted
by his precarious situation and pufillanimous temper, purchased a
peace at the expence of near two millions of our money ³⁷ ; but the
generals of Marcus, the emperor Severus, and his son, erected many
trophies in Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Ass'yria. Among their ex-
ploits, the imperfe& relation of which would have unseasonably in-
terrupted the more important series of domestic revolutions, we shall
only mention the repeated calamities of the two great cities of Se-
leucia and Ctesiphon.
