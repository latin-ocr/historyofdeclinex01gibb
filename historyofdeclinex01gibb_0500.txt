THE DECLINE AND FALL

It is almost unnecess‘ary to remark, that the civil distractione, of
the empire, the license of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbari-
ans, and the progress of despotism, had proved very unfavourable
to genius and even to learning. The succeffion of lllyrian princes
restored the empire, without restoring the sciences. Their mili-
tary education was not calculated to inspire thern with the love of
letters; and even the mind of Diocletian‚ however active and
capacious in business, was totally uninforrned by study or- specu-
lation. The profeflions of law and phyfic are of such common
use and certain profit, that they will always secure a sufficient
number of praititioners, endowed with a reasonable degree of abili-
ties and knowledge; but it does not appear that the students in*
those two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who fi0⁴uriss1ed
within that period. The voice of poetry was filent. History was
reduced to dry and confused abridgments‚ alike destitute of amuse-
ment and instruction. A languid and affected eloquence was still
retained in the pay and service of the emperors, who eucouraged
not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of
their pride, or the defence of their power ¹²³.

The declining age of learning and of mankind is marked,
however, by the rise and rapid progress of the new Platonists.
The school of Alexandria filenced those of Athens3 and the ancient
fecis enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fastiionable
teachers, who recommended their system by the novelty of their me-
rhod, and the austerity of their manners. Several of these masters,
