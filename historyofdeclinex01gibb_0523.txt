OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

very painful and linger-ing disorder. His body, swelled by an intem—
perate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence, was covered with
ulcers‚ and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insests‚ who
have given their name to a most loathsome disease ³⁷ ς but as Gale-
rius had offended a very zealous and· powerful party among his sub-
jeC‘rs, his sufferings, instead of exciting their compaffion, have been
celebrated as the visible effetas of divine justice ³⁸. He had no sooner
expiredin his palace of Nicomedia, than the two emperors who were
indebted for their purple to his favour, began to collect their forces,
with the intention either of dispudng, or of dividing, the dominions
which he had left without a master. They were persuaded however
to defist from the former design, and to agree in the latter. Theo
provinces of As1a fell to the share of Maximin, and those of Europe
augmented the portion of Licinius. The Hellespont and the Thra-
cian· Bosphorus formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of those
narrow scas, which flowed in the midst of the Roman world, were
covered with soldiers, with armS, and with fortifications. The deaths
of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors to
four. The sense of their true interest soon connected Licinius and
Constantine ; a secret alliance was concluded between Maximin and
Maxentius, and their unhappy subjects expected with terror the
bloody consequences of their inevitable diffenfions, which were no
longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they had enter-
tained for Galerius ³⁹.
