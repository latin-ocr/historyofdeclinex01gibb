k--v——d the property of the people‚ both in Italy and in Africa⁷². The

first time that Constantine honoured the senate with his presence,
he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration,
affured that illustrious order of his fincere regard, and promised
to re·establi{h its ancient dignity and privileges. The grateful
senate repaid these unmeaning profeffions by the empty titles of
honour, which it was yet in· their power to bestow3 and without
presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they paffed a
decree to affign hirn the first rank among the three ,Azcgzsti who
governed the Roman world ⁷³. Games and festivals were instituted

to preserve the farne of his vietory, and several edifices raised
at the expence of Maxentius, were dedicated to the honour of
⁴2his successful rival. The triurnphal arch of Constantine still re-
mains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arta, and a singular
testimony of the meanest vanity. As it was not poffible to find in the
capital of the empire, a sculptor who was capable of adorning that
public monument3 the arch of Trajan, without any respect either
for his memory or for the rules of propriety, was stripped of its
most elegant figures. The difference of times and persons, of
actions and charaeters, was totally disregarded. The Parthian
captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never carried
,his arms beyond the Euphratcs3 and curious antiquarians can still
discover the head of Trajan on the trophies of Constantine. The
new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the va-

cancies of ancient sculpture, are executed in the rudest and most
unskilful manner ⁷⁴.
