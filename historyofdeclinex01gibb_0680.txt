But the general affertion of Origen
may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his
friend Dionysius, who in the immense city of Alexandria, and un-
der the rigorous persecution of Decius, reckons only ten men and
seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian
name ⁷⁵.

During the same period* of persecution, the zealous‚ the eloquent,
the ambitious Cyprian governed the ehurch‚ not only of Carthage,
but even of Africa. He poffeffed every quality which could engage
the reverence of the faithful, or provoke the suspicions and restent--
ment of the Pagan magistrates. His charaCter as well as his station
seemed to mark out that holy prelate as the most distinguished object
of envy and of danger ⁷⁶. The experience, however, of the life
of Cyprian, is sufficient to prove, that our fancy has exaggerated the

perilous situation of a Christian bishop 3 and that the dangers to which

may judge with how much safety religious
honours can be ascribed to bones or urns,
indiscriminately taken from the public burial-
place. After ten centuries of a very free and
open trade, some suspicions have arisen among
the more learned catholics. They now rc-
quire, as a proof of sanciity and martyrdom,
the letters Β M, a viol full of red liquor,

⁷⁴ As a specimen of these legends, we may
be satisfied with 10‚000 Christian soldiers
crucified in one day, either by Trajan or Ha-
drian, on mount Arar-at. See Baronius ad
Martyrologium Romanum. Tillemont, Mem.
Eccleliast. tom.ii. part ii. p. 438. and Ged-
des’s Miscellanics, vol. ii. p. ²03- The ab·
breviation of Mn.. which may iignify either

supposed to be blood, or the figure of a soldius or thousands, is said to have occasioned

palm-trce. But the two former signs are of
little weight, and with regard to the last, it
i> obser-ved by the critics, 1. That the figure,
a< it is called, of a palm, is perhapsa cypr-sss,
and perhaps only a stop, the flourillt of a
comma, used iu the monumental inscriptions.
2. That the palm was the symbol of viftory
among the Pagans. 3⁴ ‘That among the
Christians it scrvcd as the emblem, not only
of martyrdom, but in general ofa joysul re-
surrezstion. See the epistle of P. Mabillon,
on the worship of unknown saints, and Mu-
ratori sopra le Antichitzi ltaliane, Diss'ertat.
