Ι. The decifive battle was fought near Naissus, a city of Dardania.
The legions at first gave way, oppreffed by numbers, and dismayed
by misfortunes. Their ruin was inevitable‚ had not the abilities
of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief. A large detachment
rising out of the secret and difficult paffes of the mountains, which, by
his order, they had occupied, suddenly affailed the rear of the vinito-

ranks, and pressed the barbarians on every fide. Fifty thousand men
are reported to have been ssain in the battle of Naissus. Several

occasioned by their own cowardice or rassmess; but the superior
talents of the emperor, his perse& knowledge of the country, and his
judicious choice of measures as well as officers, assured on most occa-

vietories, consisted for the greater part of cattle and ssaves. A selca
body of the Gothic youth was received among the ‘Imperial troops;
the remainder was sold into servitude ; and so considerable was the
number of female captives, that every soldier obtained to his share
two or three women. A circumstance from which we may con·

, clude, that the invaders entertained some designs of settlement as

well as of plunder; since even in a naval expedition they were ac-
