with such religious fidelity, that when a party of five hundred men
straggled from the camp in quest of plunder, the king or general of
the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader should be appre-
hended and ssiot to death with darts, as a vistim devoted to the sanc-
tity of their engagement& It is, however, not unlikely, that the
precaution of Aurelian, who had exacted as hostages the sons and
daughters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed something to this pacific
temper. The youths hc trained in the exercise of armS, and near his
own person5 to the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman education,
and by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers,
gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most
endearing connexions ²¹. ι

But the most important condition of peace was understood rather
than expressed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces
from Dacia, and tacitly relinquished that great province to the
Goths and Vandals ²². His manly judgement convinced him of the
solid advantage& and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace,
of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian
subjeci‘ts, removed from those distant poffeffions which they were
unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to the
southern fide of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the repe·
tition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was yielded
to their industry, and a new province of Dacia still preserved the
memory of Trajan’s conquests. The old country of that name
detained, however, a considerable number of its inhabitants, who
