OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ducted the captive emperor to Rome, and gave him the most solemn
affurances that he had secured his life by the resignation of the
purple. But Severus could obtain only an easy death and an Impe-
rial funeral. XVhen ihe sentence was fignified to him, the manner
of executing it was left to his own choice3 he preferred the favour·
ite mode of the ancientS, that of opening his veins: and as soon as
he expired‚ his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been
construc'ted for the family of Gallienus ²³.

Though the characters of Constantine and Maxentius had very
little affinity with each other, their situation and interest were the
same; and prudence seemed to require that they ssiould unite their
forces against the common enemy. Notwithstanding the superiority
of his age and dignity, the indefatigable Maximian paffed the
Alps, and courting a personal interview with the sovereign of Gaul,
carried with him his daughter Fausta as the pledge of the new
alliance. The marriage was celebrated at Arles with every circum-
stance of magnificence3 and the ancient colleague of Diocletian‚
who again affer-ted his claim to tlie western cmphe, conferred on
his son-in—law aud ally the title of Augustus. By consenting to
receive that honour from Maximian, Constantine seemed to embrace
tlic cause of Rome and of the senate; but his profeffions were am—
biguous, and his affistance ssow and ineffectual. He considered
with attention the approaching contest between the masters of Italy
and the emperor of the East, ancl was prepared to consult his own
fixfety or ambition in the event of the war ²⁴.
