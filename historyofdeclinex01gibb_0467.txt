OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

At the same time that Diocletian chastised the past crimes of the
Egyptians, he provided for their future safety and happiness by
many wisc regulations which were confirmed and enforced under the
succeeding reigns ⁴⁹. One very remarkable edidi, which he pub-
lilhed, instead of being condemned as the effect of jealous tyranny,

dieserves to be applauded as an a& of prudence and humanity. He
ι caused a diligent inquiry to be made ‘⁶ for all the ancient books
‘⁴ which treated of the admirable art of making gold and silver,
“ and without ⁴pity committed them to the flame83 apprehenfive,

if Diocletian had been convinced of the reality of that valuable
art, far from extinguishing the memory, he would have converted

more likely that his good sense discovered to him the folly of such
magnificent pretenslons, and that he was defirous of preserving the
reason and fortunes of his subjedts from the mischievous pursuit.
It may be remarked‚ that these ancient books, so liberally ascribed
'to Pythagoras, to solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds
of more recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentii‘e either to the
use or to the abuse of chymistry. In that immense register, where
Pliny has depofited the discoveries, the asts, and the errors of man-
kind, there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals;
and the persecution of Diocletian is the first authentic event in the
history of alchymy. The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs diffused
that vain science over the globe. Congenial to tbc avarice of the
