THE DECLINE AND FALL

waitcd'till the iucrealing rage of famine and pestilenee had ensured
hi> victory. The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused
Valet-ian as the cause of their calamitie83 their seditious clamours
demanded an instant capitulation. An immense sum of gold was
offered to purchase the permiffion of a disgraceful retreat. But the

Persian, conscious of his superiority, refused the money with dis-
daim and detaining the depudes, advanced in order of battle to

the foot of the Roman rampart, and infisted on a personal confer-

en'ce with the emperor. Valerian was reduced to the necessity of
intrusting his life and dignity to the saith of an enemy. The in-
terview ended as it was natural to expect. The emperor was made

*a prisoner, and his astonished troops laid down their arms ¹³⁹. In

such a moment of triumph, the pride and policy of Sapor prompted
him to fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on
his pleasure. Cyriades, an obscure fugitive of Antioch‚ stained
with every vice, was chosen to dishonour the Roman purple; and
the will of the Persian vietor could not fail of being ratified by the
acclamations, however reluctant, of the captive army ¹⁴⁰..

The imperial ssave was eager to secure the favour of his master,
by an a& of treason to his native country. He conducted Sapor
over the Euphrates, and by the way of Chalcis to the metropolis of
the East. So rapid were the motions of the Persian cavalry, that, if
we may credit a very judicious historian ¹⁴¹, the city of Antioch was
surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amuse-
ments of the theatre. The splendid buildings of Andoch, private
as well as public, were either pillaged or destroyed3 and the nume—
