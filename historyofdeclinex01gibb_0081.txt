covered an immense treasure buri'ed under an old· house, the last &ew—d
remains of his patrimony. According to the rigour· of law, the
emperor might have asserted his claim, and the prudent Atticus pre-
vented‚ by a frank confeffi0n‚ the officiousness of informers. But
the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refused to accept
any part of it; and commanded him to use, without scruple, the

present of fortune. The cautious Athenian still infisted, that the
treasure was too considerable for a subject, and that he knew not
how to 2st it. Λῖηψι it, then, replied the monarch, with a good—

opinion, that Atticus literally obeyed the emperor’s last instruetion33
s1nce he expended the greatest part of his fortune, which was much
increased by an advantageous marriage, in the service of the
Public. He had obtained for his son Herod, the prefeE'ture of the
free cities of Afia3 and the young magistrate, observing that the
town of Troas was indifferently supplied with water, obtained from
the munificence of Hadrian, three hundred myriads of drachms
(about a hundred thousand pounds) for the construnion of a new
aqueduCc. But in the execution of the work the charge amounted
to more than double the estimate, and the officers of the revenue

began to murmur, till the generous Atticus silenced their com-
plaints, by requesting that he might be permitted to take upon
himself the whole additional expence ⁶³.

The ablest preceptore of Greece and Asia had been invited by Hisrcpn-
liberal rewards to dire& the education of young Herod. Their pupil ‘²⁶⁰³'
soon became a celebrated orator according to the useless rhetoric of
that age, which, confining itself to the schools, disdained to visit

either the Forum or the Senate. He was honoured with the con-
