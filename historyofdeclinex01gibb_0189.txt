OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

petrated‚ Caracalla, with hasty steps and horror in his countenancc,
ran towards the Praetorian camp as his only refuge, and threw him-
self on the ground before the statues of the tutelar deities ³². The
soldiers attempted to 'raise and comfort him. In broken and dis-
ordered words he infor-med them of his imminent danger and for-
tunate escape3 insinuating that he had prevented the deligns of his
