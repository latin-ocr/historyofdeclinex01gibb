attached these more settled barbarians to the alliancc of Rome, and a
permanent interest very frequently ripens into fincere and useful
frIendship'. This various colony which filled the ancient province,

and was insenfibly blended into one great peoplc, still acknowledged

the superior renown and authority of the Gothic tribe, and claimed

the fancied honour ofa Scandinavian origin. At the same time the

lucky though accidental resemblance of the name of Getae, infused

age, their own ancestors, already seated in the Dacian provinces,

had received the instruction of Zam01x1s‚ and checked the victorious
