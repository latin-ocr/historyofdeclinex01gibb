OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Marcus was the only man in the empire who seemed ignorant or
insensible of the irregularities of Faustina; which, according to
Δ the prejudices of every age, reflee‘ted some disgrace on the injured
husband. He promoted several of her lovers to posts of honour and
profit ³, and during a connexion of thirty years, invariably gave
her proofs of the most tendet· confidence, and of a respect which
ended not with her life. In his Meditations‚ he thanks the gods,
who had bestowed on him a wife, so faithful, so gentle, and of
‚ such a wonderful simplicity of manners ⁴. The obsequious senate,
ἡ at his earnest request, (leclared her a goddess. She was represented
ἰ in her temples‚ with the attributes of Jnno, Venus, nnd,Ceres;
and it was decreed, that, on the day of their nuptials, the youth of

either sex should pay their vows before the altar of their chaste
patroness ⁵.

The monstrous vices of the son have cast a shade on the purity
of the father’s virtues. It has been objedied to Marcus, that he
sacrificed the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a worth-
less boy; and that he chose a successor in his own family, rather
than in the republie. Nothing, however, was negleffited by the
anxious father, and by the men of virtue and learning whom he
summoned to his assistance, to expand the narrow mind of young
Commodus, to corre-{t his growing vices, and to render him wor-
thy of the throne, for which 'ne was deligned. But the power of
instruetion is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy
dispofitions where it is almost superfluous. The distasteful leffon of
a grave philosopher was, in a moment, obliterated by the whisper of
a profligate favourite3 and Marcus himself blasted the fruits of this
