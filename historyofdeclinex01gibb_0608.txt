to so defirable an end. The ambition of raising themselves or their
friends to the honours and offices of the chureh, was disguised by
the laudable intention of devoting to the public beneffl, the power
and confideration, which, for that purpose only, it became their duty
to solicit. In the exercise of their functions, they were frequently
called upon to dete& the errors of heresy, or the arts of faffion, to
oppose the designs of perfidious brethren, to stigrnatize their cha-

a society, whose peace and happiness they had attempted to disturb.
The ecclefiastical governors of the Christians were taught to
unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocense of the d0ve3
but as the former was refined, so the latter was insenfibly cor-

the world, the persons who were placed in any public station >
rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness,
by their knowledge of mankind, and by their dexterity in business,
and while they concealed from others, and perhaps from themselves,
the secret motives of their conduCt, they too frequently relapsed
into all the turbulent paffions of affitive life, which were ti11&u1·ed
with an additional degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infu-

Rome, of Paris, of Oxford‚ and of Geneva, have alike struggled
to reduce the primitive and apostolic model ¹⁰4, to the respec-
tive standai-ds* of their own policy. The few who have pursued
this inquiry with more candour and impartiality, are of opinion ¹⁰⁵,
