ξὲῇζζῃῗέοῗὴθ younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master with the

Christians. government of Bithynia and Pontus. He soon found himself at
a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should

against the Christians‚ with whose name alone he seems to be ac-
quainted3 and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature
of their guilt, the method of their conviction, and the degree of
their punishment. In this perplexity he had recourse to his usual
