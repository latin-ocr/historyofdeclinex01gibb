OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

testimony of Origen ¹⁸³, the proportion of the faithful was very in-
confiderable when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving
world3 but, as we are left without any distinet information, it is im-
poflible to determine, and it is difficult even to conjecture, the real
numbers of the primitive Christians. The most favourable calcula-
tion, however, that can be deduced from the examples ofAntioch and
of Rome, will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth
part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under
the banner of the cross before the important conversion of Con-

apologists, than it is urged by the adversaries, of the faith; that the
new se& of Christians was almost entirely composed of the dregs of
the populace, of peasants and mechanics, of boys and women, of
beggars and ssaves, the last of whom might sometimes introduce the
miffionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged.
These obscure teachers (such was the charge of malice and infidelity)
are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in
private. Whilst they cautioussy avoid the dangerous encounter of
philosophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and
