ΙΙ. The division of Europe into a number of independent states,
connected, however, with each other, by the general resemblance
of religion, language‚ and manners, is produffive of the most bene-

who should find no reslstance either in his own breast, or in his
people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example
of his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies,
and the apprehenfion of his enemies. The object of his displeasure,
escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions‚ would easily
obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune ade-
