OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

great stream through the plains of Poland and Ruffia gave a
direc‘tion to their line of march, and a constant supply of fresh wa·
ter and pasturage to their numerous herds of cattle. They followed
the unknown course of the river, confident in their valour‚ and
careless of whatever power might oppose their progress. The
Bastarnae and the Venedi were the first who presented themselves;
and the flower of their youth, either from choice or compulsion‚
increased the Gothic army. The Bastarnae dwelt on the northern
side of the Carpathian mountains3 the immense tract of land that
separated the Bastarnae from the favages of F inland, was poffeffed,
or rather wasted, by the Venedi ²⁴: we have some reason to believe
that the first of these nations, which distinguissied itself in the
hdacedonian war ²⁵, and was afterwards divided into the formidable
tribes of the Peucini, the Boram, the Carpi, &c. derived its origin
from the Germans. With better authority, a Sarmatian extraction
may be affigned to the Venedi, who rendered themselves so famous
in the middle ages ²⁶. But the confufion of blood and manners on
that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate ob-
servers ²⁷. As the Goths advanced nearer the Euxine sea, they
encountered a purer race of Sarmatians, the Jazyges, the Alani,
and the Roxolani ; and they were probably the first Germans who
saw the mouths of the Borysthenes, and of the Tanais. If we
inquire into the charaereristie marks of the peoplc of Germany and
of Sarmatia, we shall discover that those two great portions of human
kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or moveable
tents, by a close dress, or flowing garments, by the marriage of
one or of several wives, by a military force, consisting, for the molt
part, either of infantry or of cavalry ; and above all by the use of
