THE DECLINE AND FALL

two Caesars restored new vigour to the Roman arms3 and while the

z-v--e Rhine was guarded by the presence of Ma'ximian, his brave as-

sociate Constantius assumed the conclu& of the British war. His
first enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne. A
stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the harbour, inter-

defence3 and a considerable part of the naval strength of Caraufius
fell into the hands of the besiegers. During the three years, which
Constantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest of

his power and to his danger. But he possessed not equal abilities
either to exercise the one, or to repel the other. He beheld, with

anxious terror, the opposite shores of the continent, already filled
with arms, with troops, and with vessels ; for Constantius had very
prudently divided his forces, that he might likewise divide the at-

· tention and refistance of the enemy. The attack was at length ·

made by the principal squadron, which, under the command 'of the
praefest Asclepiodotus, an officer of distinguished merit, had been
affernbled in the mouth of the Seine. So imperfect in those times

was the art of navigation, that orators have celebrated the daring ἡ
courage of the Romans, who ventured to set sail with a side-wind,
and on a stormy day. The weather proved favourablc to their
cnterprise. Under the cover of a thick fog, they escaped the fleet
of Aledius, which had been stationed off the Isse of Wight to

receive them, landed in safety on some part of the western coast;
