of Hadrian, when that mode of defence began to be praffised, these μ-Ὕ-...ι

garrisons were conne&ed and covered by a strong intrenchment os trees
and palisades. In the place of so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus

construned a stone-wall of a confiderable height, and strengthened ’

it by towers at convenient distances. From the neighbourhood of
Newstadt and Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills,
vallies, rivers, and moraffes, as far as Wimpfen on the Neeker,
and at length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a wind-
ing course of near two hundred miles 4¹. This important barrier‚
uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of Eu-
rope, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbari-
ans, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with the greatest
facility into the heart of the empire. But the experience of the world
from China to Britain, has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying
any extensive tra& of country ⁴4. An adtive enemy, who can select
and vary his points of attack, must, in the end, discover some feeble
spot or some unguarded moment. The strength, as well as the at-
tention, of the defenders is divided; and such are the blind effeets
of terror on the firmest troops, that a line broken in a single place,
is almost instantly deserted. The fate of the wall which Probus
ere&ed, may confirm the general observation. within a few years
after his death, it was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered
ruins, universally ascribed to the power of the Dcemon, now serve
only to excite the wonder of the Swabian peasant.
