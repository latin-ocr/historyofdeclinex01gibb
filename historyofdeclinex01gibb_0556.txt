530 THE DECLINE AND FALL -

C H ᾖ P. broad and rapid stream os the Hebrus, and. discovered the numerous
ss army of Licinius, which filled the steep ascent of the hill, from the
r’1ver to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were spent in doubt-
ful and distant sszirmissies ; but at length the obstacles of the passage·
and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conclu& of Con-
stantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of
Constantine, which, though it can scarcely be paralleled either in
poetry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to
his fortune, but by an historiam, the partial enemy of his fame>-
We are assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the
river Hebrus, aceompanied only by twelve horsemen, and that by

The credulity of Zosimus prevailed so strongly over his paffion,
that among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople‚ he
seems to have selected and embellished, not the most important,
but the most marvellous. The valour and danger of Constantine
are attested by a ssight wound which he received in the thigh, but it

evolutions, was reluctantly drawn from his advantageous post to
combat on equal grou-nd in the plain. The contest was no longer
equal. His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquilhed
by the experienced veterane of the West. Thirty—four thousand
men are reported to have been ssain. The fortified camp of Lici-
