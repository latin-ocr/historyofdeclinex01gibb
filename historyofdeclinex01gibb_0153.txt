HE power of the sword is more sensibly felt in an exten-

sive monarchy, than in a small community. It has been
calculated by the ablest politicians, that no state, without being soon
exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members in
arms and idleness. But although this relative proportior] may be
uniform‚ the influence of the army over the rest of the society will
vary according to the degree of its positive strength. The advan-
tages of military seience and discipline cannot be exerted, unless a
proper number of soldiers are united into one body, and actuated by
one foul. With a handful of men, such an union would be ineffec-
tual; with an unwieldy host, it would be impraCticable3 and the
powers of the machine would be alike destroyed by the extreme
minuteness, or the exceffive weight, of its springs. To illustrate
this observation we need only reflech that there is no superiority of
natural strength, artificia} weapons, or acquired skill, which could
enable one man to keep in constant subjeetion one hundred of his
fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single town, or a small district,
would soon discover that an hundred armed followers were a weak
tlcfence against ten thousand pensante, or citize1133 but an hundred
