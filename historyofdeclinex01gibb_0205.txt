‘OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The inflammatory powers of art were summoned to his aid: the
confused multitude of women, of wines‚ and of dissies, and the
studied variety of attitudes and fauces, served to revive his languid
appetitos. New terms and new inventions in these sc1ences, the
only ones cultivated and patronised by the monarch ⁵⁵, fignalized his
reign, and transmitted his infamy to succeeding times. A capricious
prodigality supplied the want of taste and elegance3 and whilst Ela-
gabalus lavissied away the treasures of his people in the wildest ex·
travagance, his own voice and that of his flatterers applauded a
spirit and magnificence unknown to the tameness of his predecessbrs.
To confound the order of seasons and climates ⁵⁷, to sport with the
pasfions and prejudices of his subjeZss, and to subvert every law of
nature and deceney, were in the number of his most delicious amuse-
ments. A long train of concubines‚ and a rapid succeflion ofwives‚
among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred
asylum ⁵⁵, were insufficient to satisfy the impotenee of his paffions.
The master of the Roman world affected to copy the dress and
manners of the female sex, preferred the distaff to the sceptre, and
dissionoured the principal dignities of the empire by distributing
them among his numerous lovers; one 0'f whom was publickly in-
vested with the title and authority of the emperor’s, or as he more
properly ssyled himself, of the empress's husband ³⁹.
