THE DECLINE AND FALL

learning was spread over the East. Origen obeyed so flattering an
invitation, and though he could not expe& to succeed in the con-
verfion of an artful and ambitious woman, {he listened with pleasure
to his eloquent exhortations‚ and honourably dismiffed him to his
retirement in Palestine ¹¹⁵. The sentiments ofMammaea were adopted
by her son Alexander, and the philosophie devotion of that emperor
was marked by a singular but injudicious regard for the Christian
religion. In his domestic chapel he placed the statues of Abraham,
of Orpheus, of Apollonius, and of Christ, as an honour justly due
to those respectable fages who had insti-ueteri mankind in the various
modes of addrefling their homage to the supreme and universal
deity ¹¹⁶. A -purer saith, as well as worlhip‚ was openly profeffed
and praffised among his household. Bissrops, perhaps for the first

. time, were seen at court3 and, after the death of Alexander, when

the inhuman Maximin discharged his fury on the favourites and ser-
vants of his unfortunate benefaetor, a great number of Christians,
of every rank and of both sexes, were involved in the promiscuous
maffacre, which, on their account, has improperly received the
name of Persecution ¹¹⁷.

Notwithstanding the cruel dispolition of Maximin, the effects of
his resentment against the Christians were of a very local and tem-

therefore, it was impossible that she should
cle-serve that honourable epithet.

the domestic religion of Alexander. His de-
iign of bnilding a public temple to Christ
(Hist. August. p. πᾳ), and the objeftion
which was suggested either to him, or in si-
milar circumstancez to Hadrian, appear to
have no other foundation than an improbable

Dion Castius, who composed his history under
the former reign, had most probably intended
for the use of his master those counsels ofper—
secudon, which he ascribes to a better age,
and to the favourite of Augustus. Concern-
ing this oration of Maecenas, or rather of
Dion, I may refer to my own unbiass‘ed opi-
