ssattering prospect of the restoration, not only of the civil but even
of the republican government. The terror of military vio-
lence, which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder of
Alexander, and to ratify the elestion of a barbarian peasant ²¹, now
produced a contrary effec'n and provoked them to affert the injured
rights of freedom and humanity. The hatred of Maximin towards
the senate was declared and implacable; the tamcst submiffion had

they were sure to be the first victims. These confiderations‚ and
perhaps others of a more private nature, were debated in a previous
conference of the consuls and the magistrates. As soon as their
'resolution was decided‚ they convoked in the temple of Castor the
whole body of the senate, according to an ancient form of secrecy ²²,
