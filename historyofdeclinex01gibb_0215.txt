OF THE ROMAN mimia.

couneils every scheme of reformation was imputed. Some trifling
accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny; and a
civil war raged, during three days, in Rome, whilst the life of that
excellent minister was defended by the grateful people. Tei-rifle&
at length, by the sight of some houses in flames, and by the threats
of a general conflagratiom the people yielded with a sig-h, and left

military license, demanded the head of the reformer. Alexander,
however, instead of yielding to their seditious chmours, shewed a
just sense of his merit and services, by appointing him his colleague
