OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

hand of Martialis, a desperate soldier, who had been refused the
rank of centurion. The devotion of Caracalla prompted him to
make a pilgrimage from Edess'a to the celebrated temple of the
Moon at Carrhae. He was attended by a body of cavalry; but
having stopped on the road for some necessary occaslon, his guards
preserved a respeetful distance, and Martialis approaching his person

under a pretence of duty, stabbed him with a dagger. The bold
affaffin was instantly killed by a Scythian archer of the Imperial
guard. Such was the end of a monster whose life disgraced human
nature, and whose reign accused the patience of the Romans ³⁹. The
grateful soldiers forgot his vices, remembered only his partial libe-
rality, and obliged the senate to prostitute their own dignity and that
of religion by granting him a place among the gods. Whilst he

was upon earth, Alexander the Great was the only hero whom this
god deemed worthy his admiration. He assumed the name and en-

figns of Alexander, formed a Macedonian phalanx of guards, perse-

asm the only sentiment by which he discovered any regard for virtue
or glory. We can easily conceive, that after the battle of Narva, and
the conquest of Poland, Charles the Twelfth (though he still wanted
the more elegant accomplifflments of the son of Philip) might boast of
having rivalled his valour and magnanimity: but in no one aetion
of his life did Caracalla express the faintest resemblance of the Mace-
donian hero, except in the murder of a great number of his own and
of his father’s friends ⁴⁰.

After the 'extinstion of the house of Severus, the Roman world
remained three days without a master. The choice of the army (for
