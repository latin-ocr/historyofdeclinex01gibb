period exempt from error and from deceit, to which -we might be,
disposed to extend the gift of supernatural powers. From the first-
of the fathers to the last of the popeS, asucceffion of bsshops, of
saints, of martyr's, and of miracles, is continued without interrup-
tion, and the progress of superstition was so gradual and almost

imperceptible, that we know not in what particular link we should
break the chain of tradition. Every age bears testimony to the
wonderful events by which it was distinguished, and its testimony
appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding
generatim, till we are insenfibly led on to accuse our own incon-
fistency, if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the
venerable Bede, or to the holy Bernard‚ the same degree of con-
fidence which, in the second century, we had so liberally granted to
justin or to Irenaeus ⁸¹. If the truth of any of those miracles is
appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had un-
believers to convince, heretics to confute‚ and idolatrous nations
to convert3 and sufficient motives might always be produced to
justify the interpofition of Heaven. And yet fince every friend to
revelation is persuaded of the reality, and every reasonable man is
convinced of the cessation, of miraculous powers, it is evident that
there must have been some period in which they were either sud-
denly or gradually withdrawn from the Christian church. What-
ever aera is chosen for that purpose, the death of the apostles‚ the
converfion of the Roman empire, or the extinCtion of the Arian
heresy ⁸², the insenfibility of the Christians who lived at that time

Bernard of Clairvaux‚ who records so many clefiastical history, does there exist a smgle
