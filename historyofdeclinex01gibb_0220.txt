THE DECLINE AND FALL

ries of the republic added less to the wealth than to the power of
Rome. The states of Italy paid their tribute in military service
only, and the vast force both by sea and land, which was exerted in
the Punic wars, was maintained at the expence of the Romans them-
selves. That high-spirited people (such is often the generous en-
thufiasm of frecdom) cheerfully submitted to the most exceffive but
voluntary burdens, in the just confidence that they should speedily
enjoy the rich harvest of their labours, Their expectations were
not disappointed. In the course of a few years, the riches of Syra-
cuse, of Carthago, of Macedonia, and of Asia, were brought in tri-
umph to Rome. The treasures of Perseus alone* amounted to near
two millions sterling, and the Roman people, the sovereign of so
many nations, was for ever delivered from the weight of taxes⁸³.
The increasing revenue of the provinces was found sufficient to
defray the ordinary establishmcnt of war and government‚ and the
superfluous mass of gold and‘filvcr was deposited in the temple of
Saturn‚ and reserved for any unforeseen emergency of the state ⁸⁴.
I-Iistory has never perhaps suffered a greater οι· more irreparable

injury, than in the loss of the curious register bcqucathed by Au-
gustus to the senate, in which that experienced prince so accurately

balanced the revenues and expences of the Roman empire ⁸⁵. D'e-
prived of this clear and comprehensive estimare, we are reduced to
collect a few imperfect hints from such of thc ancients as have acci-
dentally turned afide from the splendid to the more useful parts of·
history. We are informcd that, by the conquesss of Pompey, the
tributes of Asia were raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty·
