But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short duration. Trans-
ported, in the depth of winter, from the soft retirement of Cam-
pania, to the foot of mount Caucasus, he sunl< under the unaccus-
tomed hardships of a military life. The fatigues of the body were
aggravated by the cares of the mind. For awhile, the angry and selfish
paffions of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthufiasm of
public virtue. They soon broke out with redoubled violence, and
raged in the camp, and even in the tent, of the aged emperor. His
mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt, and he
was inceffantly tormented with faClions which he could not assuage,
and by demands which it was impoffible to satisfy. Whatever flat-
tcring expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public dis-
orders, Tacitus soon was convinced, that the licentiousness of the
army disdained the feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was
hastened by anguish and disappointment. It may be doubtful
whether the soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent
prince¹³. Itis certain, that their insolence was the cause of his death.
