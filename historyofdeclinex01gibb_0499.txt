OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 473

Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country, it C ἔζη-’ἶ 1'·
would have been exposed to the ravages of time3 but it might, per- ι--γέ--ι
haps, have escaped the rapacious industry of man. The village of
Aspalathus ¹²⁰, and long afterwards the provincial town of Spalatro,
have grown out of its ruins. The golden gate now opens into
the market place. St. John the Baptist has usurped the honours of
AEsculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under the protectiou of the
Virgin‚ is converted into the cathedral church. For this account
of Diocletian’s palace, we are principally indebted to an ingenious
artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiosity car· &eiiii os
ried into the heart of Dalmatia ¹²¹. But there is room to suspect that ’
the elegance of his defigns and engraving has somewhat flattered
the objects which it was their purpose to represent. 'vVe are in-
formed by a more recent and very judicious traveller, that the awful
ruins of Spalatro are not less expressive of the decline of the ans,
than of the greatness of the Roman empire in the time of Diocle·-
tian ¹²². If such was indeed the state of architec‘ture‚ we must na-
turally believe that painting and sculpture had experienced a still
more senfible decay. The praCtice of architectum is directed by a
few general and even mechanical rules. But sculpture, and above
all, painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the
forms of nature, but of the charafters and paffions of the human
soul. In those sublime arts, the dexterity of the hand is of little
avail, unless it is animated by fancy, and guided by the most correct
taste and observation.
