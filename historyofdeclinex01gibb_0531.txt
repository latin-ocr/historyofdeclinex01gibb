him. A numerous army of Italians was assembled under the lieu· Battle of

tenants of Maxentius in the plains of Turin. Its principal strength
consisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which the Romans, slnce
· the decline of their discipline, had borrowed from the nations of the
East. The horses‚ as well as the men, were clothed in complete
armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions
of their bodies. The aspect of this cavalry was formidable, their
weight almost irresistible3 and as, on this occasion, theIr generals
had drawn them up in a compa& column or wedge‚ with a ssiarp
point, and with spreading flanks‚ they flattered themselves that they
should easily break and trample down the army of Constantine.
They might perhaps have succeeded in their defign, had not
their experienced adversary embraced the same method of defence,
which in similar circumstances had been praffised by Aurelian.
The skilful evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this maffy
column of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fied in confusion to-
wards Turin; and as the gates of the city were shut against them,
very few escaped the sword of the vietorious pursuers. By this
important service, Turin deserved to experience the clemency and
even favour of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial
palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of Italy between the¹ Alps
and the Po not only acknowledgcd the power, but embraced with
zeal the party, of Constantine ⁵⁶.

From Milan to Rome, the AEmilian and Flaminian highxvays offered
an easy march of about four hundred miles; but though Conssan-
