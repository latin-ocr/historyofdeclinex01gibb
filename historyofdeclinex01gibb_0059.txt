OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the European mountain, the fortress of Gibraltar is now seated.
The whole extentos the Mediterranean Sea, its coasts, and its issands,
were comprised within the Roman dominion. Of the larger issands,
the two Baleares, which derive their names of Majorca and Minorca
from their resped‘tive ἧκε, are subjecit at present, the former to Spain,
the latter to Great Britain. It is easler to deplore the fate, than to
describe the αὲὶυειί condition of Corfica. Two Italian sovereigns
affume a regal title from Sardinia and Sicily. Crete, or Candia,
with Cyprus, and most of the smaller issands of Greece and Afia,
have been subdued by the Turkish arms; whilst the little rock of
Malta defies their power, and has emerged, under the government
of its military Order, into fame and opulence.

This long enumeration of provinces, whose broken fragments
have formed so many powerful kingdomS, might almost induce us
to forgive the vanity or ignorance of the ancients. Dazzled with the
extensive sway, the irresistible strength, and the real or affected mo-
deration of the emperors, they permitted themselves to despise‚ and
sometimes to forget, the outlying countries which had been left in
the enjoyment of a barbarous independence; and they gradually
usurped the licence of confounding the Roman monarchy with the
globe of the earth ⁸⁸, But the temper, as well as knowledge, of a

modern historian, require a more sober and accurate language. He
may impress a juster image of the greatness of Rome, by observing
that the empire was above two thousand miles in breadth, from the
wall of Antoninus and the northern limits of Dacia, to mount Atlas
and the tropic of Cancer3 that it extended, in length, more than
three thousand miles from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates ; that
it was fituated in the finest part of the Temperate Zone, between
the twenty-fourth and fifty-fixth degrees of northern latitude ;
and that it vvas supposed to contain above sixteen hundred thousand
square miles, {Or the most part of fertile and well cultivated land ³¹⁰.
