OF THE ROMAN EMFIRE.

Tiberius. The edicit of Marcus Antoninus is supposed to have been
the effect of his devotion and gratitude, for the miraculous deliver-
ance which he had obtained in the Marcomannic war. The distress
of the legions, the seasonable tempest of rain and hail, of thunder
and of lightning, and the dismay and defeat of the barbarians, have
been celebrated by the eloquence of several Pagan writers. If there
were any Christiane. in that army, it was natural that they should
ascribe some merit to the fervent prayers‚ which in the moment of
danger they had offered up for their own and the public safety.
But we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble, by the
Imperial medals, and by the Antonine column, that neither the
prince nor the people entertained any sense of this signal obligati0n‚
since they unanimoussy attribute their deliverance to the providence
of Jupiter, and to the interposition of Mercury. During the whole
course of his reign, Marcus despised the Christians as a philosopher,
and punished them as a sovereign ¹⁰⁶.

By a singular fatality‚ the hartlssiips which they had endured un-

acceffion of a tyrant, and as none except themselves had experi-
enced the injustice of Marcus, so they alone were protect& by the
lenity of Commodus. The celebrated Marcia, the most favoured of
his concubines, and who at length contrived the murder of her lm-
perial lover, entertained a singular affection fc& the oppressed
church3 and though it was impoffible that she could reconcile the
praffice of vice with the precepts of the Gospel, she might hope to
atone for the frailties of her sex and profession, by declaring herself
the patroness of the Christiana ¹⁰⁷. Under the gracious protection
