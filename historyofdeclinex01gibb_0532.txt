u-v-a strength and position, might either oppose his progress, or, in case

of a misfortune, might intercept his retreat. Ruricius Pompeia-nus,
a general distinguished by his valour and ability, had under his
command the city of Verona, and all the troops that were stationed
in the province of Venetia. As soon as he was informed that Con-
stantine was advancing towards him, he detaehed a large body of
cavalry, which was defeated in an engagement near Brescia, and
pursued by the Gallie ‘legions as far as the gates of Verona. The
necessity, the importance‚ and the difficulties of the siege of Verona,
immediately presented themselves to the sagacioris mind of Con·
stantine ⁵⁷. The city was acceffible only by a narrow peninsula to-
wards the west, as the other three sides were surrounded by the
Adige, a rapid river which covered the province of Venetia, from
whence the besieged derived an inexhaustible supply of men and
provifions. It was not without great difficulty, and after several
fruitless attempts‚ that Constantine found means to pass the river
at some distance above the city, and in a place where the torrent
was less violent. He then encompaffed Verona with strong lines,
pushed his attacks with prudent vigour‚ and repelled a desperate
sally of Pompeianus. That intrepid general, when he had used
every means of defence that the strength of the place or that of the
garrison could afford, 'secretly escaped from Verona, anxious not for
his own but for the public safety. With indefatigable diligence he
soon conffled an army sufficient either to meet Constantine in the
field, or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his lines.
