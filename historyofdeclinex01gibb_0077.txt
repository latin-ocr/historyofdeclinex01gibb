merchant or manufaCturer to purchase, than to hire his workmen3 ’ωε-Ν
and in the country, ssaves were employed as the cheapest and most
laborious instruments of angculture. To confirm the general ob-
servadon, and to display the multitude of ssaves, we might allego a
variety of particular instances. It was discovered, on a very me-
lancholy occasion, that four hundred ssaves were maintained iu
a single palaee of Rome ⁵⁹. The same number of four hundred
belonged to an estate, which an African widow, of a very private
condition, resigned to her son, whilst she reserved for herself a
much larger share of her property ⁶⁰. A freedman, under the reign
of Augustus, though his fortune had suffered great loffes in the
civil wars, left behind him three thousand fix hundred yoke of
oxen, two hundred and fifty thousand head of smaller cattle, and
what was almost included in the description of cattle, four thousand

The number of subjeci& who acknovvledged the laws of Rome, Pgnsslfiusnssss
of citizens, of provincials, and of ssaves, cannot now be fixed with gntae-oman

deserve. We are informed, that when the emperor Claudius ex-
ercised the office of censor, he took an account of six millions nine
hundred and forty-five thousand Roman citizens, who, with the pro-
portion of women and children, must have amounted to about twenty
millions of souls. The multitude of subjects of an inferior rank,
was uncertain and fluctuating. But, after wcighing with attention
every circumstance which could influence the balance, it seems pro-
bable, that there existed, in the time of Claudius, about twice as
many provincials as there were citizens, of either sex and of every
