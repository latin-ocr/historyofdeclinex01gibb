greatness. He soon· discovered that it was impossible to replace
that greatness on a permanent basis, without restoring public virtue,
ancient principles and manners, and the oppreffed majesty of the
laws. To execute this· noble but arduous defign, he first resolved to
revive the obsolete office of censor3 an office, which, as long as it
had subfisted in its pristine integrity‚ had so much contributed to the
perpetuity of the state ³⁷, till it was usurped and gradually neglected
by the Caesars³³. Conscious that the favour of the sovereign may
confer Q but that the esteem of the people can alone bestow
authority, he submitted the choice of the censor to the unbiassed
voice of the senate. By their unanimous votes, or rather acclama-
tiens, Valerian, who was afterwards emperor, and who then served
with distinction in the army of Decius, was declared the most
worthy of that exalted honour. As soon as the decree of the senate
was transmitted to the emperor, he ass'embled a great council in
his camp, and before the investiture of the censor elect, he apprized
him of the- difficulty and importance of his great office. “ Happy
