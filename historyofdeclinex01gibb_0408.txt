rience had enabled him to excel, he again took the field a few
months aster his triumph. It was expedient to exercise the restless
temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the Persian monarch,
exulting in the ssiame of Valerian, still braved with impunity the
offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an army, less formidable
by its numbers than by its discipline and valour‚ the emperor ad-
vanced as far as the Strcights which divide Europe from Afia. He
there cxpericnced, that the most absolute power is a weak defence
against the effects of despair. Hc had threatened one of his secre-
taries who was acculed of extortion3 and it was known that he sel-
dom threatened iu vain. The last hope which remained for the
criminal, was to involve some of the principal Officers of the army
in his danger, or at least in his fears. Artfully counterfeiting his
master’s hand, he shewed them, in a long and bloody list, their own
names devoted to death. Without suspeeting or examining the
fraud, they resolved to secure their lives by the murder of the em-
peror. On his march, between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian
was suddenly attacked by the conspirators‚ whose stations gave them a
right to surround his person ; and, after a ihort refistance‚ fell by the
hand of Mucapor, a general whom he had always loved aud trusted.
He died regretted by the army, detested by the senate, but univer-
sally acknowledged asra warlike and fortunate prince, the useful
though severe reformet of a degenerate state ⁹⁶.
