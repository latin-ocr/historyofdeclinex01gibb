OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The fate of the Gordians filled Rome with just, but unexpeEled
terror. The senate convoked in the temple of Concord, affeeted to
transaCt the common busmess of the day3 and seemed to decline,
with trembling anxiety, the consideration of their own, and the
public danger. A silent consternation prevailed on the affcmbly,
tilla senator, of the name and family of Trajan, awakened his
brethren from their fatal lethargy. He represented to them, that
the choice of cautious dilatory measures had been long since out of
their power-3 that Maxima, implacable by nature, and exasperated
by injuries, was advancing towards Italy, at the head of the military
force of the empire3 and that their only remaining alternative,
was either to meet him bravely in the field, or tamely to expe&
the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful re-
bellion. “ We have lost, continued he, two excellent princes; but
“ unless we desert ourselves, the hopes of the republic have not
“ perished with the Gordians. Many are the senators, whose virtues
“ have deserved, and whose abilities would sustam, the Imperial
‘⁶ dignity. Let us ele& two emperors, one of whom may con-
“ du& the war against the public enemy, whilst his colleague
“ remains at Rome to dire& the civil administration. Icheerfully
“ expose myself to the danger and envy of the nomination‚ and
“ give my vote in favour of Maximus and Balbinus. Ratifiy my
“ choice‚ conscript fathers, or appoint in their place, others more
“ worthy of the empire.'' The general apprehension filenced the
whispers of jealousy; the merit of the candidates was universally
acknowledged3 and the house resounded with the sincere ac-
clamations, of “ long life and victory to the emperors Max-
“ imus and Balbinus. Yon are happy in the judgmcnt of the
