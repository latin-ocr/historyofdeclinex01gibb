THE DECLINE AND FALL

invested with the second honours of the Imperial purple. Ia
describing the country, extraffiom and manners of Herculius, we
have already delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not
improper1y, styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances
both of virtue and ability‚ he appears to have poffeffed a manifest
superiority over the elder. The birth of Constantius was less obscure
than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his father, was one of the
most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of

the emperor Claudius ¹². Although the youth of Constantius had
been spent in arms, he was endowed with a rnild and amiable dispo-

sition, and the popular xi’jce had long smee acknowledged him worthy
of the rank which he at last attained. To strengthen the bonds of po-
litieal, by those of domestic union‚ each of the emperors affumed the
character of a father to one of the Caesars, Diocletian to Galerius,
and Maximian to Constantius; and each obliging them to repudiate
their former wives, bestowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted
son ¹³. These four princes distributed among themselves the wide
extent of the Roman empire. The defence of Gaul, Spain¹⁴, and
Britain, was intrusted to Constantius : Galerius was stationed on the
banks of the Danube, as the safeguard of the Illyrian provinces.
Italy and Africa were considered as the department of Maximian3
and for his peculIar portion, Diocletian reserved Thrace, Egypt, and
the rich countries of Asia. Every one was sovereign within his own
jurisdi&i0n; but their united authority extended over the whole mo-
narchy3 and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues with
his counsels or presence. The Caesars, in their exalted rank, revered

¹² Julian, the grandson of Constantius, only to the wife of Maximian. Spanheim
boasts that his family was derived stom the Differtat. xi. 2.

whether Spain was not a province of Maxi-
