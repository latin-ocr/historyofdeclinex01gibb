Janus, and marched in person into the East. On his approach with
a great army, the Perfians withdrew their garrisons from the cities
which they had already taken, and retired from the Euphrates to
the Tigris. Gordian enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the
senate the first success of his arms, which he ascribed with a becom-
ing modesty and gratitude to the wisdom of his father and praefest.
During the whole expedition, Misitheus watched over the safety
and discipline of the army3 whilst he prevented their dangeroue
murmure by maintaining a regular plenty in the camp, and by esta-
bliffling ample magazines of vinegar, bacon, straw, barley, and
when, in all the cities of thc frontier ⁴⁹. But the prosperity of
Gordian expired with Misitheus, who died of a flux, not without
very strong suspicions of poison. Philip, his successor in the prae-
fectum, was an Arab by birth, and consequently, in the earlier part
of his life, a robber by profession. His rise from so obscure a sta-

“tion to the first dignities of the empire‚ seems to prove that he was

a bold and able leader. But his boldness prompted him to aspire
to the throne, and his abilities were employed to supplant‚ not to
serve, his indulgent master. The minds of the soldiers were irri-
tated by an artificial scarcity, created by his contrivance in the
camp3 and the distress of the army was attributed to the youth and
incapacity of the prince. lt is not in our power to trace the suc-
cessive steps of the secret conspiracy and open sedition, which were
at length fatal to Gordian. A sepulchral monument was erected
