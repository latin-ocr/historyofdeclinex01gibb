κὴρ-ι belonged, immediately becomes the· object of universal as vrell as

invidious observation. In proportion to the smallness of its num-
bers, the character of the society may be affected by the virtue
and vices of the persons who compose it; and every member is en-
gaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over his own
behaviour‚ and over that of his brethren‚ fince, as he must expe&
to incur a part of the common disgrace‚ he may hope to enjoy‘
a ssiare of the common reputation. When the Christians of Bi-
thynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny, they
affured the proconsul, that, far from being engaged in any un'lawful¹
conspiracy, they were bound by a solemn obligation to abstain from
the commistion of those crimes which disturb the private or public
peace of society, from theft, robbery, adustery, perjury, and fraud ⁸⁴.
Near a century afterwards, Tertullian, with an honest pride, could
boast, that very few Christians had suffered by the hand of the
executioner, except on account of their religion⁸⁵. Their serious
and sequestered life, averse to the gay luxury of the age, inured them

virtues, As the greater number were of some trade or profeffion,
it was incumbent on them, by the strie'oest integrity and the fairest
dealing, to remove the suspicions which the profane are too apt
to conceive against the appearances of sanetity. The contempt
eof the world exercised them in the habits of humility, meekness,
and patience. The more they were persecuted, the more closely
they adhered to each other. Their mutual charity and unsuspefflng
confidence has been remarked by infidels, and was too often abused

by perfidious friends ⁸⁶.
