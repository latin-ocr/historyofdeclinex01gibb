nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius, and that

Caesar, to irritate his discontents, and to urge him to the rash
enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit
from the justice of Constantine. But the vigilant emperor dis-
covered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after
solemnly renouncing the alliance of Bassianus, despoiled him of the
purple, and inHiCted ὼε] deserved punishment on his treason and
ingratitude. The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was required
to deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in'his dominions,
