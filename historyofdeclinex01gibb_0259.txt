“ irregular republie, not unlike the Aristocracy ⁵³ of Algiers⁵⁴, where
“ the militia, poffeffed of the sovereignty, erentes and deposes a
“ magistrate, who is styled a Dey. Perhaps, indeed, it may be laid
“ down as a general mle, that a military government is, in some
‘⁶ respects, more republican than monarchical. Nor can it be said
‘⁶ that the soldiers only partook of the government by their dis-
“ obedience and rebellions. The speeches made to them by the
“ emperors, were they not at length of the same nature as those
‘² formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the tri-
