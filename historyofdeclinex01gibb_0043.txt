The cavalry, without which the force of the legion would have Cavalry-

remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops or squadrons; the
first, as the companion of the first cohort, consisted of an hun-
dred and thirty-two men3 whilst each of the other nine amounted
only to fixty-fix. The entire establissiment formed a regimem, if
we may use the modern expreffion, of seven hundred and twenty-
fix horse, naturally connected with its respective legion, but occa-
fionally separated to a& in the line, and to compose a part of the
wings of the army ⁵⁰. The cavalry of the emperors was no longer
composed‚ like that of the ancient republic, of the noblest youths
of Rome and Italy, who, by performing their military service on
