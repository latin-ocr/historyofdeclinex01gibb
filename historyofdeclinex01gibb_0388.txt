Fortifications
of Rome.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

were subservierit to the success of the war3 and if, in the decifive
battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they saw an army of speffies
combating on the fide of Aurelian, he received a real and effeRual
aid from this imaginary reinforcement ³⁹.

But whatever confidence might be placed in ideal ramparts‚ the
experience of the past, and the dread of the future, induced the
Romans to construet fortificati'ons of a groffer and more substantial
kind. The seven hills of Rome had been surrounded by the suc-
ceffors of Romulus, with an ancient wall of more than thirteen
miles ⁴⁰. The vast inclosure may seem disproportioned to the
strength and numbers of the infant state. But it was neceffary to
secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land, against the fre-
quent and sudden incur-fions of the tribes of Latium, the perpetual
enemies of the republic. With the progress of Roman greatness‚
the city and its inhabitants gradually increased, filled up the vacant
space, pierced through the useless walls, covered the field of Mars,
and, on every fide, followed the public highways in long and
beautiful suburbs ⁴¹. The extent of the new walls, erected by Au-
relian, and finifhed in *the reign of Probus, was magnified by popu-
lar estimation to near fifty 4², but is reduced by accurate measure-

ment to about twenty-one, miles ⁴ ³

monarchy. The Romans of a more prosperous age, who trusted to

the Capitoline and Palatine only, with the
adjacent vallies, were the primitive habitation
of the Roman people. But this subject would
require a dissertation.
