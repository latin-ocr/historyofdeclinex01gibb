prehending that either the mockery, or the compliance, would 'ex-
pose him to the resentment of any invisible, oras he conceived them,

seen by the primitive Christians in a much more odious and formid-

of heretics, that the daemons were the authors, the patrous, and
the objects of idolatry ³⁸. Those rebelliou‘s spirits who had been
degraded from the rank of angels, and cast down into the infernal
pit, were still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies,
and to seduce the mind& of finful men. The daemons soon discovered
and abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards
devotion, and, artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from
their Creator, they usurped the place and honours of the Supreme
Deity. By the success of their malicious contrivances‚ they at once
gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the only
comfort of which they were yet susceptible, the hope of involving
the human species in the participation of their guilt and misery.

theism, one daemon assuming the name and attributes of Jupiter,
another of AEsculapius‚ a third of Venus, and a fourth perhaps of
Apollo ³⁹ ; and that, by the advantage of their long experience and
aerial nature, they were enabled to execute, with sufficient {kill and
dignity‚ the parts which they had undertaken. They lurked
in the temple& instituted festivals and sacrifices, invented fables,
pronounced oracles, and were frequently allowed to perform
