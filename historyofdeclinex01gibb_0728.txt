which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the fixteenth
part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Ga-
lerius and Maximin3 the whole might consequently amount to about
fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between
the ten years of the persecution, will allow an annual consumption of
one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same proportion to
the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the
end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was either
