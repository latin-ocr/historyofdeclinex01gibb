tribution of property. The diligent mechanic, and the ss<31ft11
artill, who have obtained no share in the divifion of the earth,
receive a voluntary tax from the posseffors of land3 and the latter
are prompted, by a sense of interest, to improve those estates, with
whose produce they may purchase additional pleasures. This
operation, the particular effects of which are felt in every society,
acted with much more diffusive energy in the Roman world. The
provinces would soon have been exhausted of their wealth, if the
manufactures and commercc of luxury had not insenfibly restored to
the industrious subjecte, the sums which were exa&ed from them by

the arms and authority of Rome. As long as the circulation was
confined within the bounds of the empire, it impressed the political

machine with a new degree of activity, and its constquences, some-3
times beneficial‚ could never become pernicious.

But it is no easy talk to confine luxury within the limits of an
empire. The most remote countries of the ancient world were
ransacked to supply the pomp and delicaey of Rome. The forest
of Scythia affor-ded some valuable furs. Amber was brought over
land from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube3 and the bar-
barians were astonilhed at the price which they received in exchange
for so useless a commodity ¹⁰¹. There was a considerable demand
for Babyloniam carpets, and other manufactures of the east; but
the most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was
carried on with Arabia and India. Every year, about the time of
the summer solstice, a fleet of an hundred and twenty veffels sailed
from Myos-hormos‚ a port of Egypt, on the Red Sea. By the
periodical affistance of the Mons00ns‚ they traversed the ocean in
about forty days. The coast of Malabar, or the island of Ceylon ¹⁰²,

to purchase great quantities on the spot, became the principa] mart os the east.
