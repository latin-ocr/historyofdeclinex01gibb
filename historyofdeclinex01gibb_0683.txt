oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniencics of life and the *con-
seiousness of virtue. His reputation was diffuscd over Africa and
Italy ; an account of his behaviour was published for the edification
of the Christian world ⁸³5 and his solitude was frequently interrupted
by the letters, the visits, and the congratulations of the faithful.

son, but to a private house in Carthage, which belonged to one of
them. An elegant supper was provided for the entertainment of the
bishop, and his Christian friends were permitted for the last time
to enjoy his society, whilst the streets were filled with a multitude
of the faithful, anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate of
