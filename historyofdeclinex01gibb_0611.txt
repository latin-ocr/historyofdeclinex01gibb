OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

pire, had acquired in a very early period the sanction of anti-
quity ¹¹¹, and is still revered by the most powerful churches, both
of the East and of the West, as a primitive and even as a divine
establishment ¹¹². It is needless to observe, that the pious and lium-
ble presbyter8‚ who were first dignified with the episcopal title, could
not possess, and would probably have rejected, the power and pomp
which now encircles the tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre
of a German prelate. But we may defiue, in a few words, the
narrow limits of their original jurisdic'tiom which was chiefly of a
spiritual, though in some instances of a temporal, nature ¹¹³. It con-
fisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the
church, the superintendency of religious ceremonies, which imper-
ceptibly increased in number and variety, the consecration of eccle-
fiastical ministers, to whom the bishop affigned their respective func-
tions‚ the management of the public fund, and the determination
of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose be-
fore the tribunal of an idolatrous judge. These powers, during a
ssiort period, were exercised according to the advice os the prelby-
tera] college, and with the consent and approbation of the all'embly
of Christians. The primitive bissiops were considered only as the
⁷ first of their equalS‚ and the honourable servants of a free people.
Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death, a new pre-
sident was chosen among the presbytcrs by the suffrage of the whole
congregation, every member of which supposed himself invested

with a sacred and sacerdotal cha1·a6ter¹¹⁴. S 1
