tude, it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding

virtue3 but the faint impl-ession which had been received in the'
schools‚ vvas soon obliterated by the commerce and business of·
active life. We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent per-

sons who flourissied in the age of Cicero, and of the first Caesam, ·
with their adhons, their charmei-s, and their motives, to be affured

that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious

comidion of the rewards or punishments of a future state. At the

bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not appre-

hensive of giving offence to their hearers, by exposing that doc-

trine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected vvith

contempt by every man of a liberal education and understand-

ing⁵³.

Since therefore the most sublime efforts -of philosophy can extend
no further than feebly to point out the delire, the hope, or, at
most, the probability, of a future state, there is nothing, except a
divine revelation, that can asem-rain the existence, and describe
the condition, of the invislble country which is destined to receive
the souls of men after their separation from the body. But we
may perceive several defesis inherent to the popular religions of
Greece and Rome, which rendered them very uneqnal to so arduous
a tassz. 1. The general system of their mythology vvas unsupported
by any solid proofs; and the wisest among the Pagans had already
disclaimed its usnrped authority. 2. The description of the infer-
nal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and
of poets‚ who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters,
who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little equity‚
