deserts of Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the pro-
vinces of the East, which, during thirty years, had respeeced their
august dignity. D10cletian made several ineffetstual efforts to alle-

throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than
himself. Valeria consultet] her safety by a hasty ssight, and, still
accon-spanied by her mother Prisca, they wandered above fifteen
