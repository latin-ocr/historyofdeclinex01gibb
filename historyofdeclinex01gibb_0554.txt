Second civil

THE DECLINE AND FALL

In this exalted state of glory it was impossible that Constantine
should any longer endure a partner in the empire. Confiding in the
superiority of his genius aud military power, he determined‚ with-
out any previous injury, to exert them for the destrucCtion of Licinius,
whose advanced age and unpopular vices seemed to offer a very
easy conquest ¹⁰³. But the old emperor, awakened by the approach-
ing danger, deceived the expectatione of his friends as well as
of his enemies. Calling forth that spirit and those abilities by which

East, and soon filled the plains of Hadrianople with his troops,
and the Streights of the Hellespont with his fleet. The army con-
sisted of one hundred and fifty thousand foot‚ and fifteen thousand
horse; and as the cavalry was drawn, for the most part, from
Phrygia and Cappadocia, we may conceive a more favourable opinion

riders. The fleet was composed of three hundred and fifty gallies
of three ranks of oars. An hundred and thirty of these were fur—

were levied in the warlike provinces of Europe; aetion had
