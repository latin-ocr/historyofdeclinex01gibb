the Isaurians.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

negle& of an accussomed salutation, a mistake of precedency in the
public baths, or even a religious dispute ¹⁷³, were at any time sufficient
to kindle a sedition among that vast multitude, whose resentments
were furious and implacable'⁷‘. After the captivity of Valerian
and the insolence of his son had relaxed the authority of the laws,
the Alexandrinus abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage of·
their paffions, and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil
war, which continued (with a few short and suspicious truces) above

quartcrs of the afflicted city, every street was polluted with blood,
every building of strength converted into a citadel; nor did the
tumults subfide‚ till a confiderable part of Alexandria was irre-
trievably ruined. The spacious and magnificent distri& of Bruchion,
with its palaces and musaeum, the relidence of the kings and phllo-

the emperor, but to the empne, and suddenly returned to> the savage
manners, from which they had never perfeClly been reclairned.
Their craggy rocks, a branch of the wide extended Taurus, pro—
tected their inaccessible retreat. The tillage of some fertile
vallies¹⁷⁷ supplied them with the necess'aries, and a habit of rapine
with the luxuries, of life. In the heart of the Roman monarchy,
