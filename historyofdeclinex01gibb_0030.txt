vafion of the Imperial prerogative3 and it became the duty, as well
as interest of every Roman general, to guard the frontiers intrusted
to his care, without aspiring to conquests which might have proved
no less fatal to himself than to the vanquiffied barbarians ⁵.

The only accession which the Roman empire received, during
the first century of the Christian AEra, was the province of Britain·
In this single instance the succeffors of Caesar and Augustus were
persuaded to follow the example of the former, rather than the
precept of the latter. The proximity of its situation to the coast of

Gaul seemed to invite their arms3 the pleaslng‚ though doubtful
intelligence of a pearl fiffiery, attracssted their avarice⁶; and as
Britain was viewed in the light of a distinet and insulated world⁷
the conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system of
continental measures. After a war of about forty years, under-
taken by the most stupid ⁷, maintained ‚by the most dissolute,

with savage fiercenes53- they laid them down, or turned them
against each other with wild inconstaney; and while they fought
fingly‚ they were sueceffively subdued. Neither the fortitude of

³ Germanicus, Suetonius Paul-inus, and
Agricola, were checked and recalled‚ in the
course of their victories. Corbulo was put
to death. Military merit, as it is admirably
express'ed by Tacitus, was, in the strittest
sense of the word, imperatoria virtus.

⁶ Caesar himself conceals that ignoble mo-
tive; but it is mentioned by Suetonius, c.
47. The Britifh pearls proved, however, of
little value, on account of their dark and
livid colour. Tacitus observes, with reason,
(in Agricola, c. 12.) that it was an inherent
