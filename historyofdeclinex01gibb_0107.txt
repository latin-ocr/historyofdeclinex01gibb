tinued to discharge some of their least important funffions. Those
honours still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans, and the
emperors themselves, though invested for life with the powers of the
consulship, frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity,
which they condescended to share with the most illustrious of their
fenow-citizens¹⁶. Iu the electiori of these magistrates, the people‚
duringthe reign of Augustus, were permitted to expose all the in-
conveniencies of a wild democraey. That artful prince, instead of
discovering the least symptom of impaffience, humbly solicited their
sust-'rages for himself or his friends, and serupuloussy praetised all
the duties of an ordinary candidate ¹⁷. But we may venture to

to exercise it (Tacit. Annal. xri. cst). In

moderate in the pursuit‚ and exa& in the dis-
charge of it. Trajan revived the ancient
cath, and swore before the consul’s tribunal,
that he would observe the laws (Plin. Pane—
