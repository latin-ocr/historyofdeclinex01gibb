and his colleagues frequently conferi-ed the most important offic-es
on those persons, who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of
the gods, but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of
the state. The bishops held an honourable rank in their respective
provinces, and were treated with distinction and respect, not only by
the people, but by the magistrates themselves. Almost in every
« city, the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the in-

and capacioris edifices were erened for the public worship of the
faithful. The corruption of manners and principles, so forcibly
lamented by Eusebius ¹³⁵, may be considered, not only as a conse-
quence, but as aproof, of the liberty, which the Christians enjoyed
and abused under the reign of Diocletian. Prosperity had relaxed
the nerves of discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice, prevailed in every

congregation.. The presbyters·aspired to theepiscopal office, which
every day became an objeec more worthy of their ambition. The
bishops, who contended with each other for ecclesiastical pre-
eminence, appeared by their conduct to claim a secular and tyrannical
power in th‘e church; and the lively faith which still distinguished
the Christiane from· the Gentiles,- Was÷ss1eW11 much loss in their lives,
than in their controverfial writings.

Notwithstanding this seeming secursty, an attentive observer
might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a
more violent persecu-tion than any which she had yet endured. The
zeal and rapid progress of the Christiane awakened the Polytheists
from their supine indifference in the cause of those deitics, whom
custom and education had taught them to revere. The mutual pro-
vocations of a religious war, which had already continued above
two hundred years, exal'pcrated the animosity of the contending
