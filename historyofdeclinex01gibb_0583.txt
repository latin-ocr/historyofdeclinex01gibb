Yet there were a few fages of Greece and Rome who had conceived
a more exalted, and, in some respects, a juster idea of human
nature3 though it must be confeffed, that, in the sublime inquiry‚
their reason had been often guided by their imagination‚ and that their
imagination had been prompted by their vanity. When they
viewed with complaceucy the extent of their own mental powers,
when they exercised the various faculties of memory, of fancy,
and of judgmcnr, in the most profound speculamus, or the most
important labours, and when they refiezsted on the desire of fame,
which transported them into future ages, far beyond the bouude
of death and of the grave ; they were unwilling to confo'und them-
selves with the beasts of the field, or to suppose, that a being,
for whose dignity they entertained the most fincere admiration,
could be limited to a spot of earth, and to a few years of duration.
With this favourable prepoffeffion they summoned to their aid the
science, or rather the language, of Metaphyfics. They soon dis-
covered, that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the
operatione of the mind, the human foul must consequently be a
substance distinet from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual, in·-
capable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher degree of
virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison.
From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who
trod in the footsteps of Plato, deduced a very unjustifiable conclu-
sion, since they affer-ted, not only the future immortality, but the
past eternity of the human foul, which they were too apt to con·
fider as a portion of the infinite and sels-existing spirit, which per·
