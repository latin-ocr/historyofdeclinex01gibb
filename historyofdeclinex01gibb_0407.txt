Cruelty of

'his vi&ory with unrelenting rigour ⁹². He was naturally of a Aureum,

severe disposition. A peasant and a soldier, his nerves yieldcd not
easily to the impreffions of sympathy‚ and he could sustain without
emotion the fight of tortures and death. Trained from his earliest
youth in the exercise of arms, he set too small a value on the life
of a citizen, chastised by military execution the ssightest offences,
and transferred the ssern discipline of the camp into the civil adrni-
nistration of the laws. His love ofjustice often became a blind and
furious passion 3 and whenever he deerued his own or the public sasety
endangered‚ he disregarded the rules of evidence, and the proportion
of punishments. The unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans
rewarded his services, exasperated his haughty spirit. The noblest
families of the capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this
dark conspiracy. A hasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody prose-
cution, and it proved satal to one of the nephews of the emperor.
The executioners (if we may use the expreffion of a contemporary
poet) were fatigued, the prisons were crowded, and the unhappy
senate lamented the death or absence of itsaemost illustrious mem-
bers 9³. Nor was the pride of Aurelian less offenswe to that all'embly
than his cruelty. Ignorantor impatient of the restraints of civil in-
stitutions‚ he disdained to hold his power by any other title than that
of the sword, and governed by right of conquest an empire which he
had saved and subdued ⁹⁴.
