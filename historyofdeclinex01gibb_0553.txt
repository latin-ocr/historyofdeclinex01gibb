Campona, C {nl} P·

Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of several ι--Ν

memorable fieges and battles ⁹⁹3 and though Constantine en-
countered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed at length in the
contest, and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious
retreat, by restoring the booty and prisoners which they had taken.
Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the
emperor. He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent bar-
barians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head
of his legions he paffed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which
had been construcsted by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest receffes
of Dacia ¹⁰⁰, and when he had infliered a severe revenge, condescended·
to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on condition that, as often
as they were required, they ssiould supply his armies with a body

of forty thousand soldiers ¹⁰. Exploits like these were no doubt-
honourable to Constantine and benefieial to the state; but it may
surely be questioned whether they can justify the exaggerated as-
sertion of Eusebius, that ALL SCYTHIA‚ as far as the extremity of
the North, divided as it was into so many names and nations of the
most various and savage manners, had been added by his vietorious

arms to the Roman empire ¹⁰².

⁹⁹ See Zosimus, l. ii. p. 93, 94; though Constantine were like the garriens of Adonis,
the narrative of that historiari is neither clear which sade and wither almost the moment

nor consistent. The Panegyric of Optatianus
(.c. ²3·) mentions the alliance of the Sarma-
>tians with the Carpi :md Gene, and points
out the several ficlds of battle. lt is supposed,
diat the Sarmatian games, celebrated in the
month of November, derived their origin
from the success of this war.
¹⁸⁴³ In the Caesars ofJulian (p. 329. Com-
mentaioe de Spanheim, p. 252.) Constantine
boans, that he had recovered the province
γ (Dacia), which Trajan had subdued. But it
is 'rnfinuated by Silenus, ¹that the conquests of

they appear.
