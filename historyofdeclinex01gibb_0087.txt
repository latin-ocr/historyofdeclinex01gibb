Rome itself.

All these cities were connected with each other, and with the Roman

capital hythe public highways, which iffuing from the Forum of
Rome, traversed Italy, pervaded the provinces, and were termi-
nated only by the frontiers of the empire. If we carefully trace
the distance from the wall of Antoninus to Rome, a-nd from thence
to Jerusalem, it will be found that the great chain of communi-
canon, from the north-west to the south-east point of the empire,
was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty Roman

miles ⁸⁵. The public roads were accurately divided by mile-stones‚
and ran in a dire& line from one city to another, with very little>

⁸4 The inhabitants of Egypt, exclusive of
Alexandria, amounted to seven millions and
a half (Joseph. de Bell. Jud. ii. 16.). Under
the military government of the Mamalukes,
Syria was supposed to contain fixty thousand
villages. (Histoire de TimurBec, l. v. c. 20.)
