spread disorder and dismay over the camp of the barbarians. A

general confufion‚ the wounded monarch (for Narses commanded
his armies in person) fied towards the deserts of Media. His
sumptuous tentS, and those of his satraps, afforded an immense
booty to the conquerorrband an incident is mentioned, which
proves the rustic but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant
superfluities of life. A bag of ssiining leather filled with pearls,
