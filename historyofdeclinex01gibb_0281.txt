OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Armenia 5², and the long tra& of mountainous country, in which
the Persian cavalry was of little service, opened a secure entrance
into the beart of Media, to the second of the Roman armies. These
brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces, and by several success-
ful aetions against Artaxerxes, gave a faint colour to the emperor’s
vanity. But the retreat of this νίἇὶοτὶουε army was imprudent,
or at least unfortunate. In repaffing the mountains, great numbers
of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads and the severity
*of the winter season. It had been resolved that whilst these two
great detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the Per-
fian dominions, the main body, under the command of Alexander
himself, should support their attaek, by invadIng the centre of the
kingdom. But the unexperieneed youth, influeneed by his mother‘s
counsels, and perhaps by his own fears, deserted the bravest troops
and the fairest prospe& of viCtory3 and after consuming in Meso-
potamia an inactive and inglorious summer, he led back to Antioch
an army diminiihed by fickness, and provoked by disappointment.
The behaviour of Artaxerxes had been very different. Ftying with
rapidity from the hills of Media to the marshes of* the Euphrates‘
heshad every where opposed the invaders in person3 and in either
fortune, had united with the ablest conduCt the most Undaunted
resolution. But in several obstinate engagements against the vete-

ran legions of Rome, the Perfian monarch had lost the llower of his
troops. Even his vietories had weakened his power. The favour-

able opportunities of the absence of Alexander, and of the consu?

slons that followed that emperor’s death, presented themselves in
vain to his ambition. Instead os expelling the Romans, as
he pretended‚ from the continent of Asia, he found himself
