pierccd at the top to leave a free paffage for the smoke. In the
most inclement winter, the hardy German was satisfied with a scanty
garment made of the {kin of some animal. The nations who dwelt
towards the North, clothed themselves in furs; and the women ma-
nufaetured for their own use a coarse kind of linen ²⁴. The game
of various forts, with which the forests of Germany were plenti-
fully stocked, supplied its inhabitants with food and exercise ²⁵.
Their numerous herds of cattle, less remarkable indeed for their
beauty than for their utility ²⁶, formed the principal obje& of their
wealth. A small quantity of corn was the only produce exa&ed
from the earth: the use of orchards or artificial meadows was un-
known to the Germans; nor can we expe& any improvements in

that strange operation, avoided disputes, by suffering a great part of
their territory to lie waste and without tillage ²⁷.

Gold‚ filver, and iron, were extremely scarce in Cei-many. Its
barbarous inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to investigate
those rich veins of silver, which have so liber-ally rewarded the at-

a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to bestow on what
they must have (leemed the noblest use of that metal. The various
trans-aelions of peace and war had introduced some Roman coins
(chiefly silver) among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube3

use of money, carried on their confincd traffic by the exchange of
coxnmodities, and prized their rude carthen vessels as of equal value
