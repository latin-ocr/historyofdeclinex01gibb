01³ THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

fibly became more feebIe. and the name less odious3 till at length
the style of our Lord and Emperor was not only bestowed by flat-
tery‚ but was regularly admitted into the laws andr public monn.-
ments. Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the
most exceffive vanity; and if the suecefl'ors of Diocletian still de-
clined the title of King3 it seems to have been the effe& not so much
of their moderation as of their delicacy. Wherever the Latin
tongue was in use, (and it was the language of government through-
out the empire) the Imperial title, as it was peculiar to themselves,
conveyed a more respefflxlble idea than the name of King, which
they must have shared with an hundred barbarian chieftai11s3 or
which, at the best, they could derive only from Romulus or from
Tarquin. But the sentiments of the East were very different from
those of the WVest. From the earliest period of history, the sove-
reigns of Asta had been celebrated in the Greek language by the
title of Basussus, or Kingj and smee it was confidered- as the
first distinffion among mens it was soon employed by the servile
provineials of the East, in their humble addreffes to the Roman
throne ⁹⁹. Even the attributes, or at least the titles of the DrerlTY‚
were usurped by Diocletian and Maximian, who transmitted them.
to a succeffion of Christian emperors ¹0⁰. Such extravagant compli-
ments, however, soon lose their impiety by loting their meaning ;4
and when the ear is once accustomed to the found, they are heard
with indifference as vague though exceffive profeffions of respedl.
From the time of Augustus to that of Diocletian, the Roman
princes conversmg in a familiar manner among their fellow-eiti-
zens, were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid
