THE DECLINE AND FALL

We may readily believe, that the father of his country h-efi-tated
whether he ought to intrust the various and doubtful character of his
kinsman Hadrian with sovereign power. In his last moments, the
arts of the empress Plotina either fixed the irresolution of Trajan, or
boldly supposed a fic‘titious adoption³⁵⁵3 the truth of which could not
be safely disputed, and Hadrian was peaceabl'y acknowledged as his
lawful successor. Under his reign, as has been already mentioned,
the empire flourilhed in peace and prosperity. He encouraged the
arte, reformed the laws, asserted military discipline, and visited all
his provinces in person. His vast and affitive genius was equally
suited to the most enlarged views, and theminute details of civil
policy. But the ruling passions of his soul vvere curiosity'and
vanity. As¹ they prevailed, and as they were attracted by different
objests, Hadrian was, by turns, an excellent prince, a ridiculous
sophist, and a jealous tyrant. The general tenor of his condu&
deserved praise for its equity and moderation. Yet in the first days
of his reign, he put to death four consular senators, his personal
enemies, and men who had been judged worthy of empire3 and the
tediousness of a painful illness rendered him, at last, peevish and
cruel. The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a
god or a tyrant; and the honours decreed to his memory were
granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus ³⁹.
