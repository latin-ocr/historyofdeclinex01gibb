300 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C fol P. approach they raised the siege, but with a defign only of marching

k--v--J away to a conquest of greater importance, the {iege of Philippopolis,
a city of Thrace, founded by the father of Alexander, near the
foot of mount Haernus ³¹. Decius followed them through a diffi-
cult country, and by forced marches 3 but when he imagined hirn-
self at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths‚ Cniva
turned with rapid fury on his pnrsuers. The camp of the Romans
was surprised and pillaged, and, for the first time, their emperor fied 1
in disorder before a troop of half-armed barbarians. After a
long resrstance, Philippopolis, destitute of snccour, was taken by
storm. An hundred thousand persons are reported to have been
maffacred in the sack of that great city ³². Many prisoners of con·-
sequence became a valuable acceffion to the spoil, and Priscus, a
brother of the late emperor Philip, blushed not to affume the
purple under the proteffiOn of the barbarous enemies of Rome ³³.
The time, however, consumed in that tedious fiege, cnabled Decius
to rcvive the courage, restore the discipline, and recruit the numbers
of his troops, He intercepted several parties of Carpi, and other
Germans, who were hastening to ssiare the victory of their country-
rnen ³4, intrusted the pass'es of the mountains to officcrs of approved
valour and fidelity ³⁵, repaired and strengthened the fortifications of
the Danube, and exerted his utmost vigilance to oppose either the
progress or the retreat of the Goths. Encouraged by the return of
fortune, he anxioussy waited for an opportunity to retrieve, by a
great and decifive blow, his own glory‚ and that of the Roman arms*-
