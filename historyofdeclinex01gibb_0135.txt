OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 109*

nist'er's death, as the only redress of their grievances ¹⁷. This C 1*va Ρ·

nings. A spirit ofdesertiom began to prevail among the troops 3 and
the deserters, instead of seeking t-heir safety in ssight or conceal-
ment, infested the highways. Maternus, a private soldier, of a
daring boldness above his station, collected these bands of robbers
into a little army, set open the primns, invited the ssaves to affert
their freedom, and plundened with impunity the rich and defence-
less cities of Gaul and Spain. The governors of the provinces, who
had. long been the specstators, and perhaps the partners‚ of his de-
predations‚ were, at length, roused from their supine indolence by
the threatning commands of the emperor. Maternus found that
he was encompass'ed‚ and foresaw that he must be overpowered. A&
great effort of despair was his last resource. He ordered his fol·-
lowers to disperse, to pass the Alps in small parties and various
disguises, and to assemble at Rome, during the licentious tumult of
the festival *c Cybele ¹³. To murder Commodus, and to ascend
the vacant throne, was the ambition of no vulgar robber. His

measures were so ably concerted‚ that his concealed‘ troops already
filled the streets of Rome. The envy of an accomplice discovered-
and ruined this singular enterprise‚ in the moment when it was ripe
for execution '⁹. γ
