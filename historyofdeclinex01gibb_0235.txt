and unsusped'ting priuce ⁵. lf we credit another, and indeed a more
probable account, Maximin was invested with the purple by a nu-
merous detachment, at the distance of several miles from the head-
quarters 3 and he trusted for success rather to the secret 'wishes than
to the public declarations of the great army. Alexander had suffi-

Mamaea, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into his tent, defirous at

ministers of death; but, instead of receiving with manly resolution
the inevitable stroke, his unavailing eries and entreaties disgraced
