with the general proof that he was a man of property and virtue.

From this well-grounded principle he frequently drew the most

The execution of so many innocent citizens was bewailed by the ροᾳιὴ os Pa-
secret tears of their friends and families. The death of Papiniani, “mm'‘
the Praetorian praesen, was lamented as a public calamity. During
the last seven years of Severus, he had exercised the most important
office of the state, and, by his salutary influence, guided the empe-

of his virtue and abilities, Severus, on his death-bed, had conjured him
to watch over the prosperity and union ofthe Imperial family ²⁹. The
honest labours of Papinian served only to inflame the hatred which
Caracalla had already conceived against his father's minister. After
