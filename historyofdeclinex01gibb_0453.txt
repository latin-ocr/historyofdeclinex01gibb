of government. Notwithstanding the difference of their cliarafiers,

the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendlhip which

a motive either of pride or superstition, the two emperors assumed

the titles, the one of Jovius, the other of Herculius. Whilst the

motion of the world (such was the language of their venal orators)

was maintained by the all—seeing wisdom of Jupiter, the invincible

arm of Hercules purged the earth from monsters and tyrants ⁹.

But even the omnipotence ofJovius and Herculius was insufficient to Ass'ociation

sustain the weight of the public administration. The prudence of Dio- gfaetsxgg Ga-

power, and with the inferior title of Caesar-s, to confer on two generals
of approved merit an equa'l share of the sovereign authority¹⁰. Ga-
