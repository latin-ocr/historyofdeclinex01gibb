rival, who could no lon⁰ger keep the field, confined himself within
the walls of Byzantium ¹⁰⁷.

The siege of Byzantium, which was immediately undertaken by
Constantine, was attended with great labour and uncertainty. In
the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly considered

and as long as Licinius remained master of the sea, the garrison

was much less exposed to the danger of famine than the army of

the besiegers. The naval commanders of Constantine were sum-

advantage. Crispus, the emperor’s eldest son, was intrusted with
the execution of this daring enterprise, which he performed with
so much courage and succesS, that he deserved the esteem, and most
