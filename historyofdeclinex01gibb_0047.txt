OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 21

sand eight hundred and thirty-one Romans, might, with its at· C ΗΙΛ P.
tendant auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thousand five hundred k-——v—-t
men. The peace establiffiment of Hadrian and his succeffors was
composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades3 and
most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and seventy-
five thousand men. Instead of being confined within the walls of
fortified cities, which the Romans considered as the refuge of weak-
ness 'or pusillanimity‚ the legions were encamped on the banks of
the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians. As
their stations, for the most part, remained fixed and permanent,
we may venture to describe the distribution of the troops. Three
legions were sufficient for Britain. The principal strength lay
upon the Rhine and Danube, and consisted of sixteen legions,
in the following proportions: two in the Lower, and three in
the Upper Germany3 one in Rhaefia, one in Noricum, four in
Pannonia, three in Maesia, and two in Dacia. The defence of the
Euphrates was inti-ussed to eight legions, slX of whom were placed
in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With regard to Egypt³
Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any important
scene of war, a single legion maintained the domestic tranquillity
of each of those great provinces. Even Italy was not left destitute
of a military force. Abovc twenty thousand chosen soldiers, distin-
guished by the titles of City Cohorts and Praetorian Guards, watched
over the safety of the monarch and the capital. As the authors of
almost every revolution that distrac‘ted the empire, the Praetorians
will, very soon, and very loudly, demand our attention; but in their
arms and institutions, we cannot find any circumstance which dis-
criminated them from the legions, unless it were a more splendid

appearance, and a less rigid discipline ⁶⁵.
