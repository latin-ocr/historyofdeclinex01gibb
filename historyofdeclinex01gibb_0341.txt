OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more formidable aspcSt,

but more glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower em- ι

pire. Three hundred thousand of that warlike people are said to
have been vanquissxed, in a battle near Milan, by Gallienus in per-
son, at the head of only ten thousand Romans ⁹¹. 'We may how-
ever, with great probability, ascribe this incredible νίεἷὶοτγ, either to
the credulity of the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of one
of the emperor's lieutenants. It was by arms of a very different
nature, that Gallienus endeavoured to prote& Italy from the fury of
the Germans. He espoused Pipa the daughter of a king of the
Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe, which was often confounded with the
Alemanni in their vvars and conquests ⁹². To the father, as the
price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia.
The native charms of unpolilhed beauty seem to have fixed the
daughter in the affeetions of the inconstant emperor, and the bands
of policy were more firmly conned'oed by those of love. But the
haughty prejudice of Rome still refused the name of marriage, to
the profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian3 and has stigma-
tized the German princess with the opprobrious title of concubine of
Gallienus ⁹³. ’

ΙΙΙ. We have already traced the emigration of the Goths from moad> of

scandinavia, or at least from Pruffia, to the mouth of the Bory-
sthenes, and have followed their viCtorious arms from the Bory-
sthenes, to the Danube. Under the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus
the frontier of the last mentioned river was perpetually infesled by
the inroads of Germans and Sarmatian33 but it was defended by
the Romans with more than usual firmness and success. The pro-
vinces that were the seat of war, recruited the armies of Rome with
