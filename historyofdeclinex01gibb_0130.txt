THE DECLINE AND FALL

laboured education‚ by admitting his son, at the age of fourteen
or fifteen, to a full participation of the Imperial power. He lived
but four years afterwards; but he lived long enough to repent a ν
rath measure, which raised the impetuous youth above the restraint
of reason and authority.

Most of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society, are
produced by the restraints which the necessary, but unequal laws
of property, have imposed on the appetites of mankind, by confining
to a few the poffeffion of those objects that are coveted by many. Of
