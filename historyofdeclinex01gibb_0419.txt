OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, before his brother
Florianus shewed himself unworthy to reign, by the hasty usurpation
of the purple, without expedting the approbation of the senate.
The reverence for the Roman constitution, which yet influenced
the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to dispose them
to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the precipitare am-
bition of Florianus. The discontcnt would have evaporated in
idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the heroic Probus,
boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate. The contest,
however, was still unequa13 nor could the most able leader, at the
head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria, encounter, with
any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe, whose iri-efistible
strength appeared to support the brother of Tacitus. But the
fortune and affivhy of Probus triumphed over every obstacle.
The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed to cold climates,
fickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of Cilicia, where the
summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their numbers were di-
minished by frequent desertion, the paffes of the mountains vvere
feebly defended; Tarsus opened its gates, and the soldiers of Flo-
rianus, when they had permittcd him to enjoy the Imperial title
about three months, delivered the empire from civil war by the easy
sacrifice of a prince whom they despised ²⁰.

The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfec‘tly erased
every notion of hereditary right, that the family of an unfortunate
emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his succeffors.
The children of Tacitus and Florianus were permitted to descend
into a private station, and to mingle with the general mass of the
people. Their poverty indeed became an additional safeguard to
