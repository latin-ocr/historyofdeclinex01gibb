oF THE R'oMAN EMPIRE.

in* that of Romulus. The petty states of Latium were contained
within the metropolis of the empire‚ by whose superior influence
they had been attracted. Those parts of Italy which have so long
languished under the lazy tyranny of priests and viceroys‚ had
been afflicled only by the more tolerable calamities of war3 and
the first symptoms of decay, which they experienced, were amply
compensated by the rapid improvements of the Cisalpine Gaul.
The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains: yet Verona
was less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua‚ Milan or Ravenna.
ΙΙ. The spirit of improvement had paffed the Alps, and been felt
even in the woods of Britain, which were gradually cleared away

to open a free space for convenient and elegant habitations. York
was the seat of government; London was already enriched by com-
merce3 and Bath was celebrated for the salutary effects of its medi-
cinal waterS· Gaul could boast of her twelve hundred cities ⁷⁵; and
though, in the northern parts, many of them, without excepting
Paris itself, were little more than the rude and imperfed‘t townships
of a rising people3 the southern provinces imitated the wealth and
elegance of Italy ⁷⁶. Many were the cities of Gaul, Marseilles,
Arles, Nismes, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun, Vienna,
Lyons, Langres‚ and Treves, whose ancient condition might sustain
an equah and perhaps advantageous comparison with their present
state. With regard to Spain, that country flourished as a province,
and has declined as a kingdom. Exhausted by the abuse of her
strength, by Amerim, and by superstition, her pride might poffibly
be confounded, is we required such a list of three hundred and
sixty eines, as Pliny has exhibited under the reign of Vespasium ⁷⁷.
