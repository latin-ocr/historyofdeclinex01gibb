486 THE DECLINE AND FALL

ι-Ύ-ᾁμ been utterly extinguished‚ the tamest subjeers have sometimes ven-
tured to refist an unptecedented invafion of their p1·0perty; but on
this occafion the injury was aggravated by the insult, and the sense

of private interest was quickened by that of national honour. The

the dignity of Caesar, which Constantine had deserved by a danger-
