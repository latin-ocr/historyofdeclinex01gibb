lucubration. At the age of twclve years he embraced the rigid k—-v--ss

system of the Stoics‚ which taught him to submit his body to his
mind, his passions to his 1·eason; to consider virtue as the only

good, vice as the only evil, all things external, as things in*

different⁴⁶. His meditations, composed in the tumult of a camp,

ι are still extant; and he even condescended to give leffons of philo-

sophy, in a more public manner, than was perhaps consistent with
the modesty of a fage, or the dignity of an emperor47. But his
life was the noblest commentary on the precepts of Zeno. He was
severe to himself, indulgent to the imper-fection of others, just and*
beneficent to all mankind. He regretted that Avidius Caffius, who

excited a rebellion in Syria, had disappointed him, by a voluntaryffi
death, of the pleasure of converting an enemy into a friend, and he>

justified the fincerity of that sentiment, by moderating the zea] of
the senate against the adherents of the traitor ⁴⁸. VVar he detested,

as the disgrace and calamity of human nature3 but when the neces--

fity of a just defence called upon him to take up arms, he readily·
exposed his person to eight winter campaigns, on the frozen banks
of the Danube, the severity of which was at last fatal to the weak·
ness of his constitution. His memory was revered by a grateful
posterity, and above a century after his death, many persons pre-

served the image of Marcus Antoninus among those of their house--
