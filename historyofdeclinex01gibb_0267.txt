and profound sseep. As soon as he waked‚ he related to the king and to
the believing multitude, hisjourney to Heaven, and his intimate con-
ferences with the Deity. Every doubt was filenced by this supernatural
evidence; and the articles of the saith of Zoroaster were fixed with
equal authority and precision ⁰. A {hort delineation of that celebrated
system will be found useful, not only ⁸to display the character of the
Persian nation, but to illustrate many of their most important trans·-
actions, both in peace and war, with the Roman empire ¹⁰.

The great and fundamental article of the system, was the ce-
lebrated doChine of the two principles ; a bold and injudicious
attempt of Eastern philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral
and physica! evil, with the attributes of a beneficent Creator and
governor of the world. The first and original Being, in whom, or
