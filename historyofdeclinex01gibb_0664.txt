THE nEchE AND FAL'L

“ of those who were seized‚ discovered a great multitude of their
“ acco'mplices, and they were all convffi’red, not so much for the
‘⁴ crime of setting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human

“ tereti by insult and derision. Some were nailed on croffes3 others
¹* sewn up in the sszins of vvild beasts, and exposed to the fury of
‘² dogs: others again, smeared over with combustible materials,
“ were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night.
“ The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy speciacle,

rendered still more famous, by the triumph and by the abuse of the
persecuted religion. On the same spot ³⁴, a temple, which far sur-

passes the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been since erened by

words may either fignify the hatred of man- Lardner (Testimonies, vol. i. p. 345), and

the Christians towards mankind. I have pre· tion, vol. iii. p. 38.). But as the word con-
serred the latter sense, as the most agreeable «υίεῗί does not unite very happily with the
