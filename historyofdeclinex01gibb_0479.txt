OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary
between the two monarchies ⁷⁷. That river, which rose near the
Tigris, was increased a few miles below Nisibis, by the little stream
of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of Singara, and fell
into the Euphrates at Circefium, a frontier town, which, by the
· care of Diocletian, was very strongly fortified ⁷²³. Mesopotamia, the
object of so many ware, was eeded to the empire3 and the Perfians,
by this treaty, renounced all pretenfions to that great province.
II. They relinquished to the Romans five provinces beyond the
Tigris⁷⁹. Their situation formed a very useful barricr, and their
natural strength was soon improved by art and military skill. Four
of these, to the north of the river, were districts of obscure fame
and inconsiderable extent3 Intiline‚ Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Mox-
oene: but on the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large
and mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the
Carduchians‚ who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in
the heart of the despotie monarchies of Asia. The ten thousand
Greeks' traversed their country, after a painful march, or rather en-

incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered more from·
the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of the great

latter m er for the boundzrry, instead of the
former. The line ofthe Roman frontier tra-
