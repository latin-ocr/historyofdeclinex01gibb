322 THE DECLlNE AND FALL

C H 'A Γ· our ready imagination instantly computes and multiplics the for-
u-VQ midable armament; but, as we are affured by the judicious Strabo ¹²¹,
that the pyratical vessels used by the barbarians of Pontus and the
Leffer Scythia, were not capable of containing more than twenty-
five or thirty men, we may safely affirm, that fifteen thousand war-
riom, at the most, embarked in this great expedition. Impatient of
the limits of the Euxine, they steered their ‹lestruCtive course from
the Cimmerian to the Thracian Bosphorus. WVhen they had almost

of captives and deserters must have been very neceffary to pilot their,
vessels, and to dire& their various incurfions, as well on the coast of
Greece as on that of Afia. At length the Gothic fleet anchored in,
the port of Piraeus, five miles distant from Athens ¹²², which had,

damus, one of the engineers employed by the emperor’s orders to
fortify the maritime cities against the Goths, had already begun to
repair the ancient walls fallen to decay slnce the time of Sylla.
The efforts of his skill were ineffectuah and the barbarians be-
came masters of the native seat of the muses and the arts. But
while the conquerors abandoned themselves to the license of plunder
and intemperance‚ their fleet‚ that lay with a ssender guard in the⁴
harbour of Piraeus, was unexpectedly attacked by the brave Dexip-
