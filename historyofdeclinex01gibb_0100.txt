THE DECLINE AND FALL

But whilst he thus restored the dignity, he destroyed the inde-
pendence of the senate. ¹ The principles of a‘free constitution

“ senate and people to all their ancient rights; and wished only to
‘⁴ mingle with the crowd of his fellow-citizens, and to ssrare the

by the hopes and fears of each individual. Amidst this confusion
of sentiments, the answer of the senate was unanimous and decifive.
They refused to accept the resignation of Augustum they conjured
