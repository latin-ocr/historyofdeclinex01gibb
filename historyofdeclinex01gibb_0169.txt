OF THE· ROMAN EMPIRE.

tiens, and their civil victories. In less than four years ⁴², Severus
subdued the richcs of the east, and the valour of the west. He
vanquiihed two competitors of reputation and ability‚ and defeated
numerous armies, provided with weapons and discipline equal to
his own. In that age, the art of fortification‚ and the principles of
tac‘tics‚ were well understood by all the Roman generals; and the
constant superiority of Severus was that of an artist‚ who uses
the same instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals.

In the latter, they discover a want of courage5 in the other, only a

to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own personal
strength, the world, under the name of policy, seems to have
granted them a very liberal indulgence of craft and diffimulation.
Yet the arts of Severus cannot be justified by the most ample pri-
vileges of ssate reason. He promised only to heti-ay, he fiattered

oaths and treaties‚ his conscience, obsequious to his interest, always
released him from the inconvenient obligation⁴³.

If his two compefflors, reconciled by their common danger, had
advanced upon him without delay, perhaps Severus would have
