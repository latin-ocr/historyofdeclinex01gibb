330 THE DECLtNE AND FALL

C Hs& P· informers and the other ministers of oppreffi0n3 and that the re-
,μζ-’,ι formation of the coin should have been an action equally popular
with the destruClion of those obsolete accounts, which by the empe-
ror's order were burnt in the forum of Trajan ⁹⁰. In an age when
the principles of commerce were so imperfeffly understood, the
most defirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious
means; but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely ex—

cite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of intolerable
taxes, imposed either on the land or on the neceffaries of life, may
at last provoke those who will not, or who cannot, relinquifh their
country. But the case is far otherwise in every operation which, by
whatsoever expedients‚ restores the just value of money. The tran-
fient evil is soon obliterated by the permanent beneffi, the loss is

divided among multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experi-
enee a senfible diminution of treasure‚ with their riches they at the
same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they de-
rived from the poffcssion of them. However Aurelian might chuse
to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his reformation of the
coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a party already powerful
and discontented. Rome, though deprived of freedom, was dis-
traCted by faction. The people, towards whom the emperor, him-
self a plebeian, always expressed a peculiar fondness, lived in per-
petual diffension with the senate, the equestrian order, and the Prae-
torian guards ⁹¹. Nothing less than the firm though secret conspiracy
of those orders, of the authority of the first, the wealth of the second,
and the arms of the third, could have displayed a strength capable of
contending in battle vvith t'ne veteran legions of the Danube, which,

under the conduct of a martial sovereign‚ had atchieved the conquest
of the West and of the East.
