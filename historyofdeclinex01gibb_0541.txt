of Bithynia in the depth of winter. The season was severe and
tempestuous3 great numbers of men as well as horses perished
in the sn0w; and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains,
he was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the
heavy baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced
marches. By this extraordinary effort of diligencc, he arrived,
with a haraffed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian
Bosphorus, before the lieutenants of Licinius were appriscd of his
hostile intentions. Byzantium surrendered to the power of Max-
imin, after a siege of eleven days. He was detained some days
under the walls of Heraclea3 and he had no sooner taken poffeffion
of that city, than he was alarmed by the intelligence, that Licinius
had pitched his camp at the distance of only eighteen miles. After
a fruitless negociation‚ in which the two princes attempted to
seduce the fidelity of each other‘s adherents‚ they had recourse
to arms. The emperor of the East commanded a disciplined and
veteran army of above seventy thousand men, and Licinius, who
had collected about thirty thousand Illyrians, was at first oppressed
by the superiority of numbers. His military sszill, and the firmness
of his troops, restored the day, and obtained a decifive victory. The
incredible speed Which Maximin exerted in his ssight, is much more
celebrated than his prowess in the battle. Twenty-four hours after—
wards he was seen pale, trembling, and without his Imperial orna-

his defeat. The wealth of Alia was yet unexhausted5 and though the
flower of his veterans had fallen in the late action, he had still power,
if he could obtain time, to draw very numerous levies from Syria and
Egypt. But he survived his misfortune only three or four months.
His death, which happened at Tarsus, was varioussy ascribed to despair,
to poison, and to the divinejustice. As Maximin was alike destitute
of ahilitics and of virtue, he was lamented neither by the peoplc nor

by the soldiers. The provinces of the East, delivered from the
