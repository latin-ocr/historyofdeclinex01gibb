S.

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and
succeffion, were repealed, or at least moderated. Discipline was
revived, and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were en-
afied by their imperial ministers, who endeavoured to restore a civil
constitution on the ruins of military tyranny. “ What reward may
“ we expe& for delivering Rome from a monster ?’' was the question
asked by Maximus, in a moment of freedom and confidence. Bal·-
binus answered it without hesitation, “ The love of the senate, of
‘⁶ the people‚ and of all mankind.'' “ Alas !” replied his more
penetrating colleague, “ Alas! Ι dread the hatred of the soldiers,
“ and the fatal effefis of their 1·cscntn1ent³³.'’ His appi-ehenfions
were but too well justified by the event.

Whilst Maximus was preparing to defend Italy against the com-
mon foe, Balbinus, who remained at Rome, had been engaged in
scenes of blood and intestine discord. Distrust and jealousy reigned
in the senate; and even in the temples where they affembled, every
senator carried either open or concealed arms. In the midst of their
deliberations‚ two veterans of the guards, actuated either by curiosity
or a sinister motivo, audacioussy thrust themselves into the house,
and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of Vidlory. Gallicanus,
a consular, and Maecenas, a Praetorian senator, viewed with indig-
nation their insolent intrusion ε drawing their daggers they laid the
spies, for such they deemed thern, dead at the foot of the altar, and
then advancing to the door of the senate, imprudently exhorted the
multitude to maffacre the Praetorians‚ as the secret adherents of the
tyrant. Those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge
in the camp, which they defended with superior advantage against
the reiterated attacks of the people, affisted by the numerous hands
of gladiatore, the property of opulent nobles, The civil war lasted
many days, with infinite loss and confusion on both fides. When
