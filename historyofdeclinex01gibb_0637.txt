orF THE ROMAN EMPIRE,

sapostle St. James can alone, by its singular extravagance, deserve to
be mentioned. From a peaceful fitherman of the lake of Gennesa-
τεὼ, he was transformed into a valorous kniglrt, who charged at
the head of the Spanish chivalry in their battles against the Moors.
The gravest historians have celebrated his exploits; tlae miracu-
lous shrine of Compostella displayed his power; and the sword of a
military order, assisted by the terrors of the Inquisition, were suffi-
cient to remove every objeffion of profane criticism ¹⁷⁶.

The progress of Christianity was not confined to the Roman Beyondthe

limits of the

empire; and accordIng to the primitive fathers, who interpret fads Roman em-

by prophecy, the new religion, within a century after the death of pire·

its divine author, had already visited every part of the globe-z.
“ There exists not,” says Justin Martyr, ‘⁴ a people, whether Greek
“ «or Barbarian, of any other race of rnen, by whatsoever appella-

“arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tems, or wander
‘⁴‘ about in covered waggons, among whom praye-rs ⁴are not offered
“ up in the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of
“ all things¹⁷⁷.” But this splendid exaggeration, which even at

state of mankind, can be considered only as the rash sally of a devout
but careless writer, the measure of whose belief was regulated by
that of his wiihes. But neither the belief, nor the wishes of the
fathers, can alter the truth of history. It will still remain an un-
doubted fact, that the barbarians of Scythia and Germany, who after-
wards subvertcd the Roman monarchy‚ were involved in the darkness
