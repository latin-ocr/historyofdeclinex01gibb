96 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ἿΠΑ Ρ· Ifa man were callcd to fix the period in the history of the world,

μ-φ--Δ during which the condition of the human racc was most happy and
{3353ng prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed
from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus. The
vast extent of the Roman empire was governed by absolute power,
under the guidanee of virtue and wisdom. The armies were
restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four succeffive emperors,
whose charaeters and authority commanded involuntary respect. The
forms of the civil administration were carefully preserved by Nerva,
Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines‚ who delighted in the image
of liberty, and were pleased with considering themselves as the
accountable ministers of the laws. Such priuces deserved the
honour of restoring the republic‚ had the Romans of their days
been capable of enjoying a rational freedom.
Itsprecarious The labours of these monarchs were over-paid by the immense
reward that inseparably waited on their success; by the honest
pride of virtue, and by the exquisite delight of beholding the
general happiness of which they were the authors. A just, but
melancholy resseffion embittered‚ however, the noblest of hu-
man enjoyments. They must often have recolled'ted the instability
of a happiness which depended on the charadier of a single man.

The fatal moment was perhaps approaching‚ when some licentious
youth, or some jealous tyram, would abuse, to the destruCrion,
that absolute power, which they had exerted for the benefit
of their people. The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws

might serve to display the virtues, but could never corre& the
vices, of the emperor. The military force was a blind and irre-
sistible instrument of oppreffion3 and the corruption of Roman
manners would always supply flatterers eager to applaud, and rni-

nisters prepared to serve, the fear or the avarice, the lust or the
cruelty, of their masters.
