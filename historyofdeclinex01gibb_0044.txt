Auxiliaries.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

East was encumbered. 'l'heir more useful arms consisted in a
helmet, an oblong meld, light boots‚ and a coat of mail. Ajave-
lin, and a long broad sword, were their principal weapons of
offence. The use of lances and of iron maces they seem to have bor-
rowed from the barbarians ⁵⁴.

The safety and honour of the empire was principally intrussed to
the legions, but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every
useful instrument of war. Considerable levies were regularly made
among the provincials, who had not yet deserved the honourable
distinction of Romans. Many dependent princes and communities‚
dispersed round the frondem, were permitted‚ for a while, to hold
their freedom and security by the tenure of military service ⁵⁵.
Even select troops of hostile barbarians were frequently compelled

or persuaded to consume their dangerous valour in remote climates,
and for the benefit of the state ⁵⁶. All these were included under

the general name of auxiliarie83 and howsoever they might vary ac-
cording to the difference of times and circumstances, their numbers
were seldom much inferior to those of the legions themselves ⁵7·
Among the auxiliaries‚ the bravest and most faithful hands were
placed under the command of praefeets and centurions, and severely
trained in the arts of Roman discipline3 but the far greater part re-
tained those arms, to which the nature of their country, or their
early habits of life, more peculiarly adapted them. By this jn,
stitution each legion, to whom a certain proportion of auxiliaries was
allotted, contained within itself every species of lighter troops, and
