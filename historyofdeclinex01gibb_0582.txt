THE DECLINE AND FALL

it most unluckily happened that the doora were under the proteffion
of the houschold gods, that the laurel was sacred to the lover of
Daphne, and that garlands of flowem„ though frequently worn
as a symbol either of joy or mourning‚ had been dedicated in
their first origin to the service of superstition. The trembling
Christiane, who were persuaded in this instance to coinply with
the fannon of their country, and the commands of the magistrate,
laboured under the most gloomy apprehenlions, from the reproaches
of their own conscience, the censures of the church‚ and the de·
nunciations of divine vengeance ³⁰.

Such was the anxious diligente which was required to guard the
chastity of the gospel from the infeffious breath of idolatry. The
superstitious observances of public or private rites were carelessly prac-
tised‚ from education and habit, by the followers of the established
religion. But as often as they occurred, they afforded the Christiane
an opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous oppofition.
By these frequent protestations their attachment to the saith was

continually fortified, and in proportion to the increase of zeal‚ they
conibated with the inore ardour and success in the holy war, which

they had undertaken against the empire of the daemons.

ΙΙ. The writings of Cicero ⁵¹ represent in the most lively colours
the ignmance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient phi-

losophers with regard to the immortality of the soul. When
they are defirous of arming their disciples against the fear of death,

⁵⁰ Tertullian has composed a defence, or
rather panegyric, of the rasti action of a
Christian soldier, who, by throwing away
his crown of laurel, had exposed himself and
his brethren to the most imminent danger.
By the mention of the emperors (Severus and
Caracalla) it is widem, notwithstanding the
wishes of M. de Tillemont, that Tertullian
composed his treatise De Corona, long before
he was engaged in the errors of the Monta-

nisss. See Memoires Ecclesiastiques‚ tom. iii.

⁵¹ ln particular, the first book of the Tus-
culan Qestions, and the treatise De Senectute,
and the Somnium Scipionis, contain, in the
most beautiful language, every thing that
Grecian philosophy, or Roman good sense,

could possibly suggest on this dark but im-
portant subject.
