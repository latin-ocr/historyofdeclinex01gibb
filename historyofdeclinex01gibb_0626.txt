THE DECLINE AND FALL

the aid of these causes, exclufive zeal, the immediate expeetation of

,another world, the claim of miracleS, the prastice of rigid virtue,

and the constitution of the primitive church‚ that Christianity spread
itselfwith so much success in the Roman empire. To the first of these
the Christians were indebted for their invincible valour, which
disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to
vanquish. The three succeeding causes supplied their valour with the
most formidable arms. The last of these causes united their courage,
directed their arms, and gave their efforts that irresistible weight‚
which even a small band of well-trained and intrepid volunteers
has so often poffeffed over an undisciplined multitude, ignorant
of the subjed'c, and careless of the event of the war. In the various

an honourable dfflinffion, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a
public sacrifice, exhibited‚ very frequently at their own expence, the
sacred games ¹⁵¹, and with cold indifference performed the ancient
rites, according to the laws and fashion of theIr country. As they
were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life, their zeal and de-
