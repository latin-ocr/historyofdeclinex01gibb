has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of vir-‘-
tuous fimplicity. Modern Germany is said to eontain about two
thousand three hundred walled towns ¹⁷. In a much wider extent
of country, the geographer Ptolemy could discover no more than
ninety placeS, which he decorates with the name of cities ι*ς though,
according to our ideas, they would but ill deserve that splendid
title. We can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications,
construc'ted in the centre of the woods, and defigned to secure the
women, children, and cattle, whilst the warriors of the tribe marched
out to repel a sudden invasion ¹⁹. But Tacitus asserts, as a well-⁶
known fact, that the Germans, in his time, had no cities ²⁰3 and
that they affeeted to despise the works of Roman indussry, as
places of confinement rather than of security ²¹. Their edifices were
not even configuous, or formed into regular villages ²²3 each bar·
