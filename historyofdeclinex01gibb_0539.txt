OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The final abolition of the Praetorian guards was a measure of
prudence as well as of revenge. Those haughty troops, whose
numbers and privileges had been restored, and even augmentcd‚ by
Maxentius,⁴ were for ever suppreffed by Constantine. Their sortified
camp was destroyed, and the few Praetorians who had escaped the
fury of the sword, were dispersed among the legions, and banished
to the frontiers of the empire‚ where they might be serviceable
without again becoming dangerous ⁷⁵. By suppreffing the troops
which were usually stationed in Rome, Constantine gave the fatal
blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the disarmed
capital was exposed without proteffion to the insults or negle& of
its distant master. We may observe, that in this last effort to
preserve their expiring freedom‚ the Romans, from the'appre-
henfion of a tribute, had raised Maxentius to the throne. He ex-
acted that tribute from the senate, under the name of a free gift.
They implored the affistance of Constantine. He vanquished the
tyrant, and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax. The
senators, according to the declaration which was required of their
property, were divided into several classes. The most opulent paid
annually eight pounds of gold, the next class paid four, the last
two, and those whose poverty might have claimed :in exemption‚
were asseffed however at seven pieces of gold. Belides the regular
members of the senate, their sons, their descendants, and even their
γ relations, enjoyed the vain privileges, and. supported the heavy
burdens, of the senatorial order; nor will it any longer excite
our surprise, that Constantine should be attentive to increase the
number of persons who were included under so useful a descrip-
