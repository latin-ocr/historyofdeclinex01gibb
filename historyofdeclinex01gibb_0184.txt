toils of war and government. Notwithstanding his advanced age
(for he was above three-scere), and his gout, which obliged him
to be carried in a litter, he transported himself in person into that
remote issand, attended by his two sons, his whole court, and a
formidable army. He immediately pass'ed the walls of Hadrian and
Antoninus, and entered the enemy’s country, with a defign of corn-

the northern extremity of the issand, without meeting an enemy.

land, are reported to have eost the Romans above fifty thousand
men. The Caledonians at length yielded to the powerful and ob-
stinate attack, sued for peace, and surrendered a part of their arms,
and a large tract of territory. But their apparent submission lasted
no longer than the present terror. As soon as the Roman legions
had retired‚ they resumed their hostile independence. Their restless

probability, that the invasion of Severus is conneered with the most
ssiining period of the Britiffi history or fable. Rogat, whose fame,
with that >of his heroes and bards, has been revived in our language
by a recent publication, is said to have commanded the Caledonians at
