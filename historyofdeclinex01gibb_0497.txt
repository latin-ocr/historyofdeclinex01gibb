OF THEROMAN EMPIRE'.

from the city, Diocletian constru&ed ‘a magnificent palace‚ and
we may inferfrom the greatness of the work, how long hc had
meditatcd his defign of abdicating the empire. The choice of a
spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to
luxury, did not require the partiality of a native. “ The soil was
“ dry and fertile, the air is pure and wholesome, and though ex-
“ tremely hot during the summer months, this country seldom
“ feels those sultry and noxious winds, to which the coast of
“ Istria and some ¹parts. of Italy are exposed. The views from
“ the palace are no less beautiful than the soil and climate was in-
“ viting. Towards the west lies the fertile {hore that stretches
“ along the Hadriane, in which a number of small issands are
‘⁴ scattered in such a manner, as to give this part of the sea the
“ appearance of a great lake. On the north fide lies the hay,
‘⁶ which led to the ancient city of Salona3 and the country be-
“ yond it, appearing in fight, forms a proper contrast to that
“ more extensive prospect of water, which the Hadriatic presents
‘⁶ both to the south and to the east. Towards the north, the view
‘³ is terminated by high and irregular mountains, fituated at a
“ proper distance, and, in many places, covered with villages,
“ woods, and vineyards¹¹⁷.’'

Though Constantine, from a very obvious prejudice, affests to
mention the palace of Diocletian with contempt ¹¹³, yet one of their
