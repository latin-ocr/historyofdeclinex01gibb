laws ¹ . He studied to heal the wounds which imperial pride, civil k--r—-e

discord, and military violence, had infilCted on the constitution,
and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient republic, as it had
been preserved by t'he policy of Augustus, and the virtues of Trajan
and the Antonines. It may not be useless to recapitulate some
of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to
have regained by the electiori of Tacitus ¹³. 1. To invest one of their
body, under the title of emperor, with the general command of the
armies and the governrncnt of the frontier provinces. 2. To
determine the list, or as it was then styled, the College of Consuls.
They were twelve in number, who, in succeffive pairs, each, during
the space of two months, filled the year, and represented the dignity
of that ancient office. The authority of the senate, in the nomination
of the consuls, was exerciscd with such independent freedom, that no
regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor in favour of
his brother Florianus. “ The senate,’' exclaimed Tacitus, with tlte
honest transport of a patriot, ⁴‘ understand the clia1·after of a prince
“ whom they have chosen.'' 3. To appoint the proconsuls and pre·
sidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates their
civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the intermediate
office of the praese& ofthe city from all the tribunals of the empire-
5. To give force and validity, by their decrees, to such as they should
approve of the empcror’s edicts. ὁ. ΤΟ these several branches of
authority, we may add some inspeCffion over the finances, sume, even
in the stern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part
of the revenue from the public service ¹⁴.
