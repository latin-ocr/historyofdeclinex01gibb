all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible; the saith and
valour‚ the hospitality and the courtesy‚ so conspicuous long after-
wards in the ages of chivalry. The honourable gifts, bestowed by
the chief on his brave companions, have been supposed, by an in-
genious writer, to contain the first rudiments of the fiefs, distributcd,
after the conquest of the Roman provinces, by the barbarian lords

saith and chassity of the Gcrmans.
