OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

venue of Egypt is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five
hundred talents3 a sum equivalent to more than two millions and
a half of our money, but which was afterwards confiderably im·
proved by the more exa& oeconomy of the Romans, and the increase
of the trade of AEthiopia and India '⁵⁷- > Gaul was enriched by rapine,

as Egypt was by commerce, and the tributes of those two great pro-
vinces have been compared as nearly equal to each other in value ⁸⁸.

The ten thousand Euboic or Phoenician talents‚ about four millions
sterling ⁸⁹, which vanquiffied Carthage was condemned to pay within
the term of fifty years, were a ssight acknowledgment of the superio-

rity of Rome ⁹⁰, and cannot bear the least proportion with the taxes
afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the inhabit-

ants, when the fertile coast of Africa was reduced into a province ⁹¹.
Spain, by a very singular fatality‚ was the Peru and Mexico of
the old world. The discovery of the rich western continent by the
Phoenieians, and the oppreffion of the simple nativos, who were
compelled to labour in their own mines for the benefit of strangers,
form an exa& type of the more recent history of Spanish America ⁹².
The Phoenicians were acquainted only with the sea-coast of Spain;
avarice, as well as ambition, carried the arms of Rome and Carthage
into the heart of the country, and almost every part of the soil was
found pregnant with copper, silver, and gold. Mention is made ofa
mine near Carthagena which yicldcd every day twenty—five thousand

drachms of sister, or about three hundred thousand pounds a
year 9³. Twenty thousand pound weight of gold was annu-
