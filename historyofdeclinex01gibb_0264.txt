suceess'ors. The Medes and the Babylonians divided their power,
and were themselves swallowed up in the monarehy of the Pernam,
whose arms could not be confined within the narrow limits of Asia,

followed, as it is said, by two millions of men, Xerxes, the descendant
of Cyrus, invaded Greeee. Thirty thousand fildiers‚ under the
command of Alexander, the son of Philip, who was intrusted by
the Greeks with their glory and revenge‚ were sufficient to subdue

Persia. The princes of the house of Seleucus usurped and lost the
Macedonian command over the East. About the same> time, that,

by an ignominious treaty‚ they resigned to the Romans the country
on' this fide Mount Taurus, they were driven by the Parthians, an
obscure horde of Scythian origin, from all the provinces of Upper
Afia. The formidable power of the Parthians, which spread from
India to the frontiers of Syria, was in its turn subverted by Ardffiir,
or Artaxerxes; the founder of a new dynasty, which, under the
name of Saffanides, governed Persia till the invasion of the Arabs.
This great revolution, whose fatal influence was soon experienced by
the Romans, happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus,
