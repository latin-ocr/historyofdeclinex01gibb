THE DECLINE AND FALL

protec‘lion of some powerful chief, who acquircd ovcr their persons
and property, the same absolute rights as, among the Greeks and
Romans, a master exer-cised over his ssaves ¹⁸. The greatest part
of the nation was gradually reduced into a state of servitude3 com-
pelled to perpetual labour on the estates of the Gallie nobles, and
confined to the soil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the
no less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws. During the long
series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of Gallienus ¹
to that of Diocletian, the condition of these servile peasants was
peculiarly miserable3 and they egperienced at once the complicated
tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of the soldiers‚ and of
the officers of the revenue ¹⁹.

Their patience was at last provoked into despair. On every fide
they rose in rnuhstudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with ir·-
refistilile fury. The ploughman became a foot soldier, the shep-
herd mounted on horseback, the deserted villages and open towns
were abandoned to the flames, and the ravages of the peasants
equalled those of the fiercest barbarians ²⁰. They asserted the natural
rights of men, but they asserted those rights with the most savage
cruelty. The Gallie nobles justly dreading theirlrevenge, either
took refuge in the fortified cities‚ or fled from the wild scene of
anarchy. The peasants reigned without control; and two of their
most during leaders had the folly and rassmess to assume the Im-
perial ornaments ²¹. Their power soon expircd at the approach of
the legions. The strength of union and discipline obtained an easy
viCtory over a licentious and divided multitude²². A severe re-
taliation was inflicted on the pealants who were found in arms:
