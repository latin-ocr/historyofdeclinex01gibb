were the most preeious and acceptable offering to their altars. Some
applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion, enter-
tained by that people‚ of the Deity‚ whom they neither confined
within the walls of a temple, nor represented by any human figure3
but when we recolle& that the Germans were unlkilled in archi-
tenure, and totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture, we shall
readily affign the true reason of a scruple, which arose not so much»
from a superiority of reason, as from a want of ingenuity. The
only temples in Germany were dark and ancient groves, conse-
crated by the reverence of succeeding generations. Their secret
gloom, the imagined refidenee of an invisible power, by presenting
no distinet objeet of fear or worship, impreffed the mind with a still
deeper sense of religious horror ⁶³ 3 and the priests, rude and illiterate
as they were, had been taught by experience the use of every

artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to
their own interest.

The same ignorance, which renders barbarians incapable of con- Its effet‘ts in
ceiving or embracing the useful restraints oflaws, exposes them naked peace,

and unarmed to the blind terrors of superstition. The German priestS,
improving this favourable temper of their countrymen‚ had affumed
a jurisdictiom even in temporal concerns, which the magistrate

could not venture to exercise3 and the haughty warrior patiently
submitted to the laih of cormeum, when it was inflictetl, not by

any human power, but by the immediate order of the god of
