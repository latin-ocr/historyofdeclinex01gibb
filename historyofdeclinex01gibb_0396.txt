snstain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They fied in
real or affected disorder‚ engaged the Palmyrenians in a laborious
pursuit, harass'ed them by a desultory cornbat, and at length dis-

light infantry, in the mean time, when they had exhausted their
quivers, remaining without protection against a closer onset, exposed
their naked fides to the swords of the legions. Aurelian had chosen
these veteran troops, who were usually stationed on the Upper

detached Probus the bravest of his generals to possess himself of the
Egyptian provinces. Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of

by some invaluable springs, was capable of producing fruits as well
as corn. A place poll'effed of such singular advantages, and litu-
