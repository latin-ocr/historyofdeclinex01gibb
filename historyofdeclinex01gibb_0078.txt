perse& calculation would rise to about one* hundred and twenty
inillions of persons: a degree of population which possibly exceedS
that of modern Europe ⁶², and forms the most numerous society that
has ever been united under the same system of government.

Domestic peace and union were the natural consequences of the
moderate and comprehensive policy embraced by the Romans. If
we turn our eyes towards the monarchies of Afia, we shall behold
despotism in the centre, and weakness in the extremities ; the
collection of the revenue, or the administration of justice, enforced
by the presence of an army3 hostile barbarians established in the
heart of the country, hereditary satraps usurping the dominion of
the provinces, and subjecte inclined to rebellion, though incapable of
freedom. But the obedience of the Roman world was uniform, vo-
luntary, and permanent. The vanquished nations, blended into one
great people, resigned the hope, nay even the wish, of resuming their
independence, and scarcely confidered their own existence as distin&
from the existence of Rome. The established authority of the em-
perors pervaded without an effort the wide extent of their dominions,
and was exerciscd with the same facility on the banks of the Thames,
or of the Nile, as on those of the Tyber. The legions were des-
tined to serve against the public enemy, and the civil magistrate sel·-
dom required the aid of a military force ⁶³. In this state of general
security‚ the leisure as well as opulence both of the prince and people,
were devoted to improve and to adom the Roman empire.
