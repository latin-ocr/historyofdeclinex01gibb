THE DECLmE AND FALL

But they were astonished that the Christiane should abandon the
temples of those ancient heroes, who, in the infancy of the world,
had invented arta, instituted laws, and vanquished the tyrants or
inonsters who infested the earth ; in order to choose for the exclusive
obje& of their religious worship, an obscure teaeher, who, in a
recent age, and among a barbarous people‚ had fallen a sacrifice
either to the malice of his own countrymen, or to the jealousy of
the Roman government‘. The Pagan multitude, reserving their
gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected the inestimable present
of life and immortality, which was offered to mankind by Jesus of
Nazareth. His rnild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary
sufferingS, his universal benevolence, and the sublime fimplicity of his
actions and charaeter, were insufficient, in the opinion of those

carnal men, to compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and
of success; and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupen-
dous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave, they
misrepresented‚ or they insulted, the equivocal birth, wandering
life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author of Christia-

nals. It is well known, and has been already observed‚ that Roman
poliey viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any affociation
among its subjesrs; and that the privileges of private corporations‚
though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes, were be-
ssowed with a very sparing hand ¹4. The religious affemblies of the
