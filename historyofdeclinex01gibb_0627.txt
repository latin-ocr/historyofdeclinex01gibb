OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

votion were seldom animated by a sense of interest, or by the habits
of an ecclefiastical character. Confined to their respedlive temples
and eines, they remained without any connexion of discipline or
government3 and whilst they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction
of the senate, of the college of pontiffs‚ and of the emperor, those
civil magistrates contented themselves with the easy tassz of main-
mining, in peace and dignity, the general worship of mankind. We
have already seen how various, how loose, and how uncertain were
the religious sentiments of Polytheists. They were abandoned, al-

deities, it was scarcely poffible that their hearts could be susceptible
ofa very fincere or lively passion for any of thern.

When Christianity appeared in the world, even these faint and
