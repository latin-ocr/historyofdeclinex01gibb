security. A measure so consonant to reason was soon authorized by
the advice and example of the most holy prelates3 and seems to

into heresy by their strist and obstinate adherence to the rigour of
ancient discipline ¹⁰⁰. Π. The provincial governors, whose zeal was
less prevalent than their avarice, had countenanced the practice of
selling certificates (or libels as they were called), which attested, that
the persons thei-ein mentioned had complied with the laws, and sa-

rations, the opulent and timid Christians were enabled to si-
lence the malice of an informer, and to reconcile in some mea-
sure their safety with their religion. A ssight pennance atoned
for this profane diffimulation ¹⁰¹. Ill. In every persecution there

were great numbers of unworthy Christiane, who publickly disowned
or renounced the saith which they had profeffed3 and who con-

incense or of offering sacrifices. Some of these apostates had yielded
on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate3 whilst the
patience of others had been subduecl by the length and repetition of
tortures. The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their in-

to the altars of the gods ¹0². But the disgnisc, which fcar had im-
