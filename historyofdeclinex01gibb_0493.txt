OF THE. ROMAN EMPIRE. 467

vinces. From the inclemency of the weather, and the fatigue of the C {Hs} P·
journey, he soon cona-acted a ssow illness ; and though he made easy ι--ν--ι
marches, and was generally carried in a close litter, his dfforder, be-
fore he arrived at Nicomedia, about the end of the summer, was
become very serious and alarming. During the whole winter hc was
confined to his palace3 liis danger inspired a general and unaffecffffl
concern3 but the people could only judge of the various alterations of
his health, from the joy or consternation which they discovered in
the countenances and behaviour of his attendants. The rumour of
his death was for some time universally believed, and it was supposed
to be concealed, with a view to prevent the troubles that might have
happened ‘during the absence of the Caesar Galerius. At length,
however, on the first of March, Diocletian once more appeared in
public, but so pale and emaciated, that he could scarcely have been
recognised by those to whom his person was the most familiar. It was His pru-
tIme to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had sustained deme*
during more than a year, between the care of his health and that of
his dignity. The former ,required indulgence and relaxation, the
latter compelled him to direct, from the lied of fiekness, the admini-
stration of a great empire. He resolved to pass the remainder of his
days in honourable repose, to place his glory beyond the reach of
fortune, and to relinquish the theatre of the world to his younger
and more aitive affociates ¹⁰³.

The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious
plain, about three miles from Nicomedia. The emperor ascended
a lofty throne, and in a speech, full of reason and dignity, de-
clared his intention, both to the people and to the soldiers who were

assembled on this extraordinary occasion. As soon as he had divested A. D. 305·

'0⁴3 Aurelius Victor ascribes the abdication, pending troubles. One of the panegyrista
which had been so varioussy accountcd for, to (vi. 9.) mentions the age and infirmitics of
two causes: ist, Diocletian's contempt of am· Diocletian, as a very natural reason for his
