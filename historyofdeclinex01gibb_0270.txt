THE DECLINE AND FALL

But there are some remarkable instances, in which Zoroasser lays
afide the prophet, affumcs the legissator, and discovers a liberal
concern for private and public happiness, seldom to be found among
the groveling or visionary schemes of superstition. Fasting and
celibacy‚ the common means of purchasing the divine favour,
he condemns with abhorrence, as a criminal rejeffion of the best
gifts of providence. The saint, in the Magian religion, is obliged
to beget children, to plant useful trees, to destroy noxious animals,
to convey water to the dry lands of Persia, and to work out his
salvation by pursuing all the labours of agriculture. We may quote
from the Zendavesta a wife and benevolent maxim, which com-
pensates for many an absurdity. “ He who sows the ground with
“ care and diligence‚ acquires a greater stock of religious merit, than
“ he could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers ¹⁵.’'
In the spring of every year a festival was celebrated, destined to
represent the primitive equality, and the present connexion, of man-
kind. The stately kings of Persia, exchanging their vain pomp
for more genuine greatness, freely mingled with the humblest bnt
most useful of their subjeets. On that day the husbandmen were
admitted, without distinction, to the table of the king and h-is
satraps. The monarch accepted their petitions, inquired into their
grievances, and conversed with them on the most equal terms.
“ From your labours, was he accustomed to say, (and to say with
“ truth, if not with sincerity,) from your labours, we receive our
“ subsistence3 you derive your tranquillity from our vigilance3 since,
“ therefore, we are mutually necess'ary to each other, let us live
“ together like brothers in concord and love ¹⁶.'‘ Such a festival
must indeed 'nave degenerated, in a wealthy and despotic empire,
