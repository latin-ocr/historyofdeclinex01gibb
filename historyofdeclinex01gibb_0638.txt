THE DECLINE AND FALL

of paganism ; and that even the converfion of Iberia, of Armenia, or
of AEthiopia, was not attempted with any degree of success till the
Before that
time, the various accidents of war and commerce might indeed
diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the gospel among the tribes
of Caledonia ¹⁷⁹, and among the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube,
and the Euphrates ¹⁸⁰. Beyond the last mentioned river, Edeffa was
distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith ¹⁸¹. From
Edessa, the principles of Christianity were easily introduced into the
Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the succeffors of Artaxerxes;
but they do not appear to have made any deep impreffion on the
minds of the Persians, whose religious system, by the labours of a
well-disciplined order of priests, had been construered with much

more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of Greece and

sceptre was in the hands of an orthodox emperor ¹⁷³.

Rome ¹³².

From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of
Christianity, it may perhaps seem probable, that the number of its
proselytes has been exceffively magnifieri by sear on the one fide,

and by devotion on the other.

¹⁷3 See the fourth century of Mosheim’s
History of the Church. Many, though very
confused circumstances, that relate to the con-
verfion of Iberia and Armenia, may be found
in Moses of Chorene, l. ii. c. 78—89.

’79 According to Tertullian, the Christian
saith had penetrated into parts cfEritain inac-
‹cllible to the Roman arms. About a century
afterwards, Offian, the son ofFingal‚ issm‘dto
have dispumd, in his extreme old age, with
one of the foreign miffionaries, and the dis-
pute is still extant, in verse, and in the Erse
languagc. See Mr. Maepherson’s Disl'erta-
tion on the Antiquity osOssian’s Poenis, p. 10.

¹⁸³ The Goths, who ravaged Asia in the
reign of Gallienus, carried away great num-
bers of captives; some of whom were Chris-
tians, and became miffionaries. See Tille-

According to the irreproachable

mont, Memoires Ecclefiast. tom. iv. p. 44.

¹¹³¹ The Legend of Abgarm, fabulous :ts it
is, affords a decifive proof, that many years
before Eusebius wrote his history, the greatest
partof the inhabitants ofEdeffa had embraced
Christianity. Their rivals, the citizens of
Carrhae, adhered, on the contrary, to the
cause of Paganism, as late as the fixth cen-
turv.

¹⁵² According to Bardesenes (ap. Euseb.
Praepar. Evangel.) there were some Christians
in Persia before the end of the second century.
In the time of Constantine (see his Epistle to
Sapor, Vir. l. iv. c. 13.) they composed a
flourishing church. Consult Beansolue, Hist.
Critique du Manicheismc, tom. i. p. 180. and
the Bibliotheca Orientalis of Affemani.
