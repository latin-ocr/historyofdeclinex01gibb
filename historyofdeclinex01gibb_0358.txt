THE DECLINE AND FALL

'l‘hc emperor Gallienus, who had long supported with impatiencc
the censorial severity of liis father and colleaguc, received the in-
telligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed
inclifference. “ l knew that my father was a mortal‚'’ said he,
“ and since he has aeced as becomes a brave man, 1 am satisfied.’‘
Whilst Rome lamented the fate of her sovereign‚ the savage cold-
ness of his son was extolled by the servile courtiers, as the perse&
firmness of a hero and a stoic ¹⁵². It is difficult to paint the light,
the various, the inconstant character of Gaffienuffiyvhich he dis-
played without constraint, as soon as he became sole possessor of the
empire. In every art that he attempted, his lively genius enabled
him to succeed; and as his genius was destitute of judgment, he
attempted every art, except the important ones of war and govern-
ment. He was a master of several curious but useless sciences,
a ready orator, an elegant poet ¹³³, a sszilful gardener, an excellent
cook, and most contemptible prince. When the great emergencies of
the state required his presence and attention, he was engaged in con-
versation with the philosopher Plotinus ¹⁵⁴, wasting his time in trifling
or licentious pleasures, preparing his initiation to the Grecian mys-
tedes, or soliciting a place in the Areopagus of Athens. His profuse
magnificence insulted the general poverty ; the solemn ridicule of his

triumphs impreffed a deeper sense of the public disgrace ¹⁵⁵. The re-

¹⁵³ There is still extant a very pretty Epi-
thalamium, composed by Gallienus, for the
nuptials of his nephews.

¹⁵⁴ He was on the point of giving Plotinus
aruined city of Campania, to try the experi-
ment of realizing Plato’s Republic. See the

legend and reverse ; the former Gallienae Au-
gzstae, the latter Ubique Pax. M. spanheim
supposes that the coin was struck by some of the
enemies ofGallienus‚ and was defigned as a se-
vere satire on that effeminate prince. But as the
use of irony may seem unworthy osthegravity
ofthe Roman mint, M. de Vallemont has de—
