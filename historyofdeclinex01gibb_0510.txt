British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colIeague,
as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave
him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman
princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his
favourite Severus. The apparent harmony of the empire was still
preserved, and Constantine, who already poffeffed the substance,v
expe6³oed, without impatience, an opportunity of obtaining the ho-
nours, of supreme power ¹⁷.

The children of Constantius by his second marriage were fix in
number, three of either sex, and whose Imperial defcent might
have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of
Helena. But Constantine was in the thirty—second year of his age,
in the full vigour both of mind and body, at the time when the¹
eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than thirteen years ⁷
old. His claim of superior merit· had been allowed and ratified by
the dying emperor ¹³. In his last‘ moments, Constantius bequeathed
to his eldest sorr the care of the safety as well as greatness of the fa-
mi1y3 conjuring him to affume both the authority and the senti-2

liberal education, advantageous marriages‚ the secure dignity of their·
lives, and the first honours of the state with which they were in·-
vested‚ attest the fraternal affeffion of Constantine3 and as those-
princes poffeffed a mild and grateful dispofiti0n‚ they submitted with<-
