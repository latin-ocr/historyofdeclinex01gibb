THE DECLINE AND FALL

The legions of Galerius exhibited a very melancholy proof of

retreat. They murdered‚ they ravished, they plundered, they
drove away the floeks and herda of the Italians, they burnt the·
villages through which they paffed, and they endeavoured to
destroy the country, which it had not been in their power to
subdue. During the whole march, Maxentius hung on their rear,
but he very prudently declined a general engagement with those
brave and desperate veterans. His father had undertaken a second
journey into Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who
had assembled an army on the frontier, to join the pursuit and τοι
complete the victory. But the astion-s of Constantine were guided‘»
by reason and not by resentment. He persisted in the wise resolution
of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire, and he no:
longer hated Galerius, when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an·
object of terror ²⁸.

The mind of Galerius was the most fiisceptible of the sternet

ank of paffions, but it was not however incapable of a sincere and lasting

friendffiip. Licinius, whose manners as well as character were
not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affeffion and
esteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period
perhaps of their youth and obscur-ity. It had been cernented· by
the freedom and dangers of a military life3 they had advanced‘,
almost by equal steps, through the succeffive honours of the ser-
vice, and as soon as Galerius was invested with the ImperiaP
dignity, he seems to have conceived the design of ralsmg his com·
panion to the same rank with himself. During the short period of²
his prosperity he considered the rank of Caesar as unworthy of
the age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him
