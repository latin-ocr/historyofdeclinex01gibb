OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm ex-
‘preffion of a contemporary), “ when the proportion of those who
“ received, exceeded the proportion of those who contributed‚ the
“ provinces were oppreffed by the weight of tributes ‘⁰⁴2‘ From this
period to the extinction of the empire, it would be easy to deduce
an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints. According
to his religion and situation, each writer chuses either Diocle-
tian, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodotius, for the object of
his invectives; but they unanimoussy agree in representing the bur-
den of the public impolitions, and particularly the land-tax and
capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own
times. From such a concurr-enee, an impartial historian who is
obliged to extra& truth from satire as well as from panegyric, will
be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they ac-
cuse, and to ascribe their exaetions much less to their personal vices,
than to the uniform system of their administration. The emperor
Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but during his
reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty
and disci-enon, and he deserves the reproach of establishing per·
nicious precedents, rather than of exercifing actual oppression ¹⁰³. It
may be added, that his revenues were managed with prudent oeco-
nomy; and that after all the current expences were discharged,
there still remained in the Imperial treasury an ample provifion ei-
ther for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state.

It was in the twenty-first year of his reign that Diocletian exe-
cuted his memorable resolution of abdicating the empire; an affilion
