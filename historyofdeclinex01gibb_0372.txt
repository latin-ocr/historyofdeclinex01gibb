THE DECLINE AND FALL

appointinents of the praefect of Egypt, the establilhmeut of the pro-
consul of Africa, and the sure prospe& of the consulship. By his
viCtories over the Goths, he deserved from the senate the honour of a
statue, and exeited the jealous apprehensions of Gallienus. It was
impossible that a soldier could esteem so dissolute a sovereign, nor isit
easy to conceal a just contempt. Some unguarded expressions which
dropt from Claudum, were officioussy transmitted to the royal ear.
The emperor's answer to an officer of confidence, describes in very
lively colours his own character and that of the times. “ There is not
“ any thing capable of giving me more serious concern, than the in-
“ telligence contained in your last dispatch⁴3 that some malicious
“ suggestions have indisposed towards us the mind of otir friend and
“ parent Claudius. As you regard your allegiance, use every means
“ to appease his resentment, but conducit your negociation with se-
“ crecy3 let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops; they
“ are already provoked‚ and it might inflame their fury. 1 myself
“ have sent him some presents: be it your care that he accept them
“ with pleasure. Above all, let him not suspect that I arn made ac-

humble epistle‚ in which the monarch solicited a reconciliation with
his discontented subjeci, confisted of a considerable sum of money, a
splendid wardrobe, and a valuable service of silver and gold plate. By
such arts Gallienus softened the indignation, and dispelled the fears,
of his lllyrian general3 and, during the remainder of that reign, the
formidable sword of Claudius was always drawn in the cause of a
master whom he despised. At last, indeed, he received from the
