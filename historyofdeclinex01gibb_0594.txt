563 THE DECLINE AND FALL'

C {VA P. described as a favour very liberally bestowed ,on all ranks of the

W faithful, on women as on elders‚' on boys as well as upon bissiops. Λ
W'hen their devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of

prayer, of fasting, and of vigils‚ to receive the extraordinary im- -

pulse‚ they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in
extasy what was inspired, being mere organs of the holy spirit, just
as a pipe or fiute is of him who blows into it ⁷⁵. We may add,
that the defign of these vifions was, for the most part, either to dis-
close the future history, orto guide the present administration of
the church. The expulsion of the daemons from the *bodies of
those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted to tormenlt,
was confidered as a signal though ordinary triumph of religion,
and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apologists, as the most con-
vincing evidence of the truth of Christianity. Th'e awful ceremony
was usually performed in a public manner, and in the presence of a
great number of speftator53 the patient was relieved by the power
or skill of the exorcist, and the vanquished daemon was heard to
confess, that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity, who had
impioussy usurped the adoration of mankind ⁷⁶. But the miracu-
lous cure of diseases of the most inveterate or even preternatural
kind, can no longer occasion any surprise, when we recolleec, that
in the days of Irenaeus, about the end of the second century, ‘the
resurreffion of the dead was very ‘far from being esteemed an un-
common event3 that the miracle was frequently performed on neces-
sary occasions, by great fasting and the joint supplication of the
church of the place, and that the persons thus restored to their

⁷⁵ Athenagoras in Legatione. Justin Mar- 7³ Tertullian (Apolog. c. 23.) throws out
tyr, Cohort. ad Gentes. Tertullian advers. a bold defiance to the Pagan magistrates. Of
Marcionit. 1. iv. These descriptions are not the primitive miracles, the power of exor-
very unlike the prophetie fury, for which cifing, is the only one which has been as-
cicero (de Divinat. ii. 54.) expresses so little suined by Protestants.
