assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the Caspian
Sea ⁶¹. The civil war was, however, soon terminated, either by a vie-
tory or by a reconciliat'10n3 and Nat-ses, who was universally acknow-

enemy. The contest then became too unequa13 nor was the valour of
the hero able to withstand the power of the monareh. Tiridates, a
second time expelled from the throne of Armenia, once more took
refuge in the court of the emperors. Narses soon re-establissied his
authority over the revoltcd province3 and loudly complaining of the
protee‘tion afforded by the Romans to rebels and fugitives, aspired
to the conquest of the East ⁶².

Neither prudence nor honour could permit the emperors to forsake
the cause of the Armenian king, and it was resolved to exert the
force of the empire in the Persian war. Diocletiam with the calm
dignity which he constantly assumed, fixed his own station in the
city of Antioch, from whence he prepared and diredsted the military

operations ⁶³. The conduet of the legions was intrusted to the in-
