THE DECLINE. AND FALL

traverso the Danube and the Roman camp, broke through the posts
in their rear, which were more feebly or less carefully guarded; and
with incredible diligence, but by a different road, returned towards
the mountains of Italy³². Aurelian, who considered the war as
totally exdnguistmd, received the mortifying intelligence of the
escape of the Alemanni, and of the ravage which they already
committed in the territory of Milan. The legions were com-
manded to follow, with as much expedition as those heavy bodies
were capable of exerting‚ the rapid flight of an enemy, whose in-
fantry and cavalry moved with almost equal swiftness. A few days
afterwards the emperor himself marched to the relief of Italy, at
the head of a chosen body of auxiliaries (among whom were the ¹
hostages and cavalry of the Vandals), and of all the Praetorian guards
who had served in the wars on the Danube ³³.

As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from
the Alps to the Apennine, the inceffant vigilance of Aurelian and
his Officers was exercised in the discovery, the attack‚ and the pursuit
of the numerous detachments. Notwithstanding this desultory
war, three considerable battles are mentioned, in which the principal
force of both armies was obstinately engaged ³⁴. The success was
various. In the first, fought near Placentia, the Romans received
so severe a blow, that, according to the expreffion of a writer ex-
tremely partial to Aurelian, the immediate diffolution of the empire
was apprehended³⁵. The crafty barbarians, who had lined the
woods, suddenly attacked the legions in the dusk of the evening,
and, as it is most probable‚ after the fatigue and disorder ofa long
march. The fury of their charge was irrefistible3 but at length,
after a dreadful ssaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied
his troops, and restored, in some degree, the honour of his arms:
