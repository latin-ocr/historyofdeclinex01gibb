which is the just result of knowledge and experience. Warriors of
such a during spirit must have often murmured against the cowardice
of their guidcs‚ who required the strongest affurances of a settled
cahn before they would venture to embark3- and would scarcely
ever be temptcd to lose sight of the land. Such, at least, is the
practice of the modern Turks ¹⁰⁴3 aud they are probably not in-
ferior, in the art of navigation‚ to the ancient inhabitants of Bos-
phorus.

The flect of the Goths, leaving the coast of Circaslia on the left
hand, sirst appeared before Pityus ¹⁰⁵, the utmost limits of the Ro·
man provinces3 a city provided with a convenient port and fortified
with a strong wall. Here they met with a resistance more obsti-
nate than they had reason to expe& from the feeble garrison of a
distant sortress. They were repulsed3 and their disappointment
seemed to diminish the terror of the Gothic name. As long as
Succesiianus, an officer of superior rank and merit, defended that
frontier, all their efforts were ineffectuah but as soon as he was
removed by Valerian to a more honourable but less important
station, they resumed the attack of Pityus ; and, by the destruction
of that city, obliterated the memory of their former disgrace ¹⁰⁶.

Circling round the eastern extremity of the Euxine sea, the
navigation from Pityus to Trebizond is about three hundred

country of Colchis, so famous by the expedition of the Argo-
nauts ; and they even attempted, though without success, to pillage
a rich temple at the mouth of the river Phaiis. Trebizond‚ cele-
