‚governmenn Marcus, on the other hand, revered the charaCter of

characteristic of both princes. But the situation of the latter opened
a much larger field for the exercise of those virtues. Numa could
only prevent a few neighbouring villages from plundering each

of mankind. In private life, he was an amiable‚ as well as a good
