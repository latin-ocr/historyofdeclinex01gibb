Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power. Α

Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the pro-
vince westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the Roman
yoke‚ extended itself over a third part of Europe. Almost the whole
of modern Germany, Denmark‚ Norway, vaeden, Fimand, Livonia‚
pruma, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by the various
tribes of one great nation, whose complexion‚ manners, and language,
denoted a common origin, and preserved a striking resemblance. On
the west, ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallie,
and on the south, by the Danube, from the IUyrian, provinces of
the empire. A ridge of hius, rising from the Danube, and called
the Carpathian Mountains‚ covered Germany on the side of Dacia
or Hungary. The eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mu-
tual fears of the Germans and the Sarmatiam, and was often con-
founded by the mixture of warring and confederating tribes of the
two nations. In the remote darkness of the north, the ancients im-
perfec‘kly deseried a frozen ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea, and
beyond the Peninsnla, or issands ¹ of scandinavia.
