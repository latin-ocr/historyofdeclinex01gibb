THE DECLINE AND FALL

ment of the people ⁸⁵. By the order of Probus, a great quantity
of large treeS, torn up by the roots, were transplanted into the midst
of the circus. The spacious and ssiady forest was immediately filled
with a thousand ostriches‚ a thousand stags‚ a thousand fallow deer, and
a thousand wild boars ς and all this variety of game was abandoned
to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude. The tragedy of the suc-
ceeding day consisted in the maffacre of an hundred lions, an equal
number of lioneffes‚ two hundred leopardS, and three hundred

bears . The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his

ι triumph, and which his succeffor exhibited in the secular garnes,

was less remarkable by the number than by the fingularity of the
animale. Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and varie-
gated beauty to the eyes of the Roman people ⁸⁷. Ten elks‚ and as
many camelopards, the loftiest and most harmless creatures that
wander over the plains of Sarmatia and AEthiopia, were contrasted
with thirty African hyaenas, andlten Indian tygers, the most im-
placable savages of the torrid zone. The unoffending strength with
which Nature has endowed the greater quadrupedes, was admired
in the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile ⁸⁸, and a majestie
troop of thirty-two elephants ³⁹. While the populace gazed with
stupid wonder on the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed ob-
serve the figure and properties of so many different species, trans—
ported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre
