THE DECLINE AND FALL

The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation
of these primitive, martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural
mistake. The ecclefiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries
ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable
and *unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the
heretics or the idolate'rs of their own times. It is not improbable
that some of those *persons who were raised to the dignities of the
empire‚ might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace,
and that the cruel disposition of others might occafionally be
stimulated by motives of avarice or of persona} resentment ⁶⁶.
But it is certain, and we may appeal to the grateful confeffions of
the first christiam, t'hat the greatest part of those magistrates who
exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor, or of the
senate, and to whose hands alone the jurisdietion of life and death
was intrusted, behaved like men of polissied manners and liberal·
educations, who respedted the rules of justice, and who were conver-
sant with the precepts of philosophy. They frequently declined the
odious talk of persecution‚ dismissed the charge with. contempt,
or suggested to the accused Christian some legal evaslOn, by which
he might elude the severity of the laws ⁶⁷. ⁷Whenever they were
invested with a discretionary power⁶³‚ they used it much less for
the oppreflion, than for the relief and benefit, of the afflieted church·
They were far from condemning all the Christians who were ac-
cused before their tribunal, and very far from punilhing with death
