OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Among the innumerable monuments of architecture construeted

by the Romans, how many have escaped the notice of history, how
few have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism l And yet even

the majestic ruins that are still scattered over Italy and the pro—
vinces, would be sufficient to prove, that those countrIes were once
the seat of a polite and powerful empire. Their greatness alone, or
their beauty, might deserve our attention3 but they are rendered
more interesting, by two important circumstances, which conne& the
agreeable history of the arts‚ with the more useful history of human
manners. Many of those works were erected at private expence,

public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of
the empire, were executed, not only by his orders, but under his
immediate inspection. He was himself an artist3 and he loved the
arts, as they conduced to the glory of the monarch. They were
encouraged by the Antonines, as they contributed to the happiness
of the people. But if the emperors were the first, they were not the*
only architects of their dominions. Their example was universally
imitated by their principal subjefts, who were not afraid of declar-
