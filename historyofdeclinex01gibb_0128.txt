THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. lV.

The cruclt ν, follia, and murder of Commodus.--Ele5?i0n
of Pertinax—his attempts to reform the State—his

affafflnati-on by the Praetorian Guards.

HE mildness of Marcus, which the rigid discipline of the
¹ Stoics was unable to eradicate, formed, at the same time,
the most amiable, and the only defective, part of his charaeter.
His excellent understanding was often deceived by the unsuspee'cing
goodness of his heart. Artful men, who study the paffions of princes,
and conceal their own, approached his person in the disguise of
philosophie sanCtity, and acquired riches and honours by affeeting
to despise them '. His exeeffive indulgence to his brother, his wife,
and his son, exceeded the bounds of private virtue, and became a
public injury, by the example and consequences of their vices.
Faustina, the daughter of Pius and the wife of Marcus, has been
as much celebrated for her gallantries as for her beauty. The
grave fimplicity of the philosopher was ill-calculated to engage her
wanton levity, or to fix that unbounded paflion for variety, which
often discovered personal merit in the meanest of mankind ². The
‘Cupid of the ancients was, in general, a very sensual deity3 and

the amours of an empress, as they exa& on her side the plainest

advanees, are seldom susceptible of much sentimental delicacy.
