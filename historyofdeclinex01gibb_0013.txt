ILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an
historical writer may ascribe to himself3 if any merit indeed
can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty. Ι

may therefore be allowed to say, that I have carefully examined
all the original materials that could illustrate the subject which

I had undertaken to treat. Should 1 ever complete the extensive
design which has been skctched out in the Preface‚ I might perhaps?
conclude it with a critical account of the authors consulted during
the progress of the whole work3 and however such an attempt
might incur the censure of ostentation‚ Ι am persuaded, that it would
be susceptible of entertainment as well as information.

At present Ι shall content myself with a single observation. The
Biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine3
cornposed, or rather compiled‚ the lives of the emperors, from¹
Hadrian to the sons of Carus, are usually mentioned under the
names of AElius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, AElius Lampridius,

Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiscus.
But there is so much perplexity in the titles of the MSS.; and so

many disputes have arisen among the critics (see Fabricius Biblioth.
Latin. l. iii. c. 6) concerning their number, their names, and their
respective property, that for the most part Ι have quoted them with-
out distinction, under the general and well known title of the,

Augzgstan Hisswy.
