OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 399

'⁴‘ fustaining so strange and infernal an aspect. Of all our senseS‚ C {In-[⁴. P.
⁶‘ the eyes are the first vanquished in battle³⁹.'’ Yet the arms ι--γ--ι-ῖ
and discipline of the Romans easily discomfited these horrid phan-
toms. The Lygii were defeated in a general engagement, and Semno,
the most renowned of their chiefs, fell alive into the hands of Probus.
That prudent emperor, unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair,
granted them an honourable capitulation‚ and permitted them to
return in safety to their native country. But the loffes which they
suffered in the march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power
of the nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history
either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is
reported to have eost the lives of four hundred thousand of the in-
vaders3 a work of labour to the Romans, and of expence to the
emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barba-
rian ³⁹. But as the fame of warriors is built on the destruction of
human kind, we may naturally suspeet, that the sanguinary account
wasmultiplied by the avarice of the soldiers, and accepted without

any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of Probus.
Since the expedition of Maximin‚ the Roman generals had con- ‘³9⁶¹ 0²³5&ss

fined their ambition to a defenfive war against the nations of Ger· lgserfflxgyi'nm
many, who perpetually preffed on the frontiers of the empire. The
more daring Probus pursued his Gallie victories, paffed the Rhine‚
and displayed hisinvincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the
Necker. He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the
minds of the barbarians to peace, unless they experienced in their

own country the calamities of war. Germany, exhausted by the
ill success of the last emigration, was astonissied by his presence.
Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his camp, and feli
prostrate at his feet. Such a treaty was humbly received by tho
Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate. Hc emeleri τ.
