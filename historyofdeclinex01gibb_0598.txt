¹2 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H ᾼ Ρ· Ριωξὶεά by prophecy, and surprifingly delivered from dan-

μμῖᾑ.) ger, fiekness‚ and from death itself, by the supplications of the
church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so fre-
quently conceived themselves to be the objeCrs, the instruments,
or the spec‘tators‚ very happily disposed them to adopt with the same
ease, but with far greater justice, the authentic wonders of the
evangelie history; and thus miracles that exceeded not the measure
of their own experience, inspired them with the most lively affurance
of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their
understanding. It is this deep impression of supernatural truths,
which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith3 a
state of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favour
and of future felicity, and recommended as the first or perhaps the
only merit of a Christian. According to the more rigid docCtors,
the moral virtues, which may be equally praCtised by infideIs, are
destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of ourjustification.

Tm IV. But the primitive Christian demonstrated his saith by his

giss? virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the divine per-suafion
Xfffffiss f which enlightened or subdued the understanding, must, at the same¹

Chnstians· time, purify the beart and dire& the aCtions of the believer. The
first apologists of Christianity who justify the innocence of their
brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the san&ity
of their ancestms, display, in the most lively colours, the reforma-
tion of manners which was introduced into the world by the*
preaching of the gospel. As it is my intention to remark only
such human causes as were permitted to second the influence of
revelation, I shall ssightly mention two motives which might
naturally render.the lives of the primitive Christians much purer
and more austere than those of their Pagan contemporaries or their
degenerate successor53 repentance for their past fins, and the laud-

able defire os supporting the reputation of the society in which they
were engaged.
