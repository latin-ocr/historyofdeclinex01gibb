he wouldrhave lived for ever in a state of virgin purity, and that
some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise
with a race of innocent and immortal beings⁹¹. The use of mar-
riage was permitted only to his fallen postersty, as a neceffary ex-

of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject, betrays the per-
plexity of men, unwilling to approve an institution, which they were
compelled to tolerate⁹². The enumeration of the very whimslcal
laws, which they most circumstantially imposed on the marriage-
bed, would force a smile from the young, and a blush from the

to consider a state of celibacy as the nearest approach to the Divine
perfeffi'tion. It was with the utmost difficulty that ancient Rome
