OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

by a Syrian or Arab of Palmyra.

The voice of history, which is often little more than the organ
of hatrcd or flattery, reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the
rights of conquest. We are told that Valeriam, in chains, but in-
vested with the Imperial purple, was exposed to the multitude a con-
fiant spectacle of fallen greatness; and that whenever the Perfian
monarch mounted on horseback, he pla-ced his foot on the neck of
a Roman emperor. Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his
allies, who repeatedly advised him to remember the viciffitude of
fortune, to dread the returning power of Rome, and to make his
illustrions captive the pledge of peace, not the obje& of insult, Sapor
still remained inflexible. When Valerian sunk under the weight of
{hasne and grief, his ikia, stuffed. with straw, and formed into the
likeness of a human figure, was preserved for ages in the most cele-
brated temple of Perfia3 a more real monument of triumph, than
the fancied trophies of‘brass· and marble so often erected by Roman
vanity ¹⁵⁰. The tale is moral and pathetic‚ but the truth of it rnay

treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia, it is
at least certain, that the only emperor of Rome who had ever fallen

into the hands of the enemy, laiiguished away his life in hopeless

captivity.
