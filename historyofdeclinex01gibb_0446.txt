a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or the
superiority of his genius ¹0¹. But the talenta of Numerian were
rather of the contemplative, than of the aestive kind. When his
father’s elevation reinelantly forced him from the shade of retire-
ment, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him for the
command of armies. His constitution was destroyed by the hard-
ships of the Persian war; and he had eontrae'oed, from the heat of
the climate ¹⁰², such a weakness in his eyes, as obliged him, in the
course of a long retreat, to confine himself to the solitude and dark-
ness of a tent or litter. The administration of all affairs, civil as
well as military, was devolved on Arrius Aper, the Praetorian prae-
feel, who, to the power of his important office, added the honour
of being father-in—law to Numerian. The Imperial pavilion was
striffly guarded by his most trusty adherents; and during many
days, Aper delivered to the army the supposed mandates of their
invisible sovereign ¹⁰³. ¹

It was not till eight months after the death of Carus, that the
Roman army, returning by ssow marches from the banks of the

Tigris, arrived on those of the Thracian Bosphorus. The legions
halted at Chalcedon in Afia, while the court paffed over to He-

raclea, on the European fide of the Propontis ¹⁰⁴. But a report
