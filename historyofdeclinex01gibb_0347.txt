OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

When the city of Cyzicus withstood the utmost effort of Mithri·

dates ¹¹⁴, it was distinguished by wife laws, a naval power of two
hundred gallies, and three arsenals3 of arms, of milit-ary engines, and
of corn ‘¹⁵. It was still the seat of wealth and luxury3 but of its
ancient strength, nothing remained except the situation, in a little
issand of the Propontis, connected with the continent of Asia only
by two bridgeS. From the recent sack of Prusa, the Goths ad-
vanced within eighteen miles ¹¹⁶ of the city, which they had de-
voted to destruction3 but the ruin of Cyzicus was delayed by a for-
tunate accident. The season was rainy, and the lake Apolloniates,
the reservoir of all the springs of Mount Olympus, rose to an un-
common height. The little river of Rhyndacus, which iss‘ues from the
lake, swelled into a broad and rapid stream, and stopped the progress
of the Goths. Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where
the fleet had probably been stationed, was attended by a long train
ofwaggons, laden with the spoils of Bithynia, and was marked by
the flames of Nice and Nicodemia‚ which they wantonly bui-nt ¹¹⁷.·
Some obscure hints are mentioned of a doubtful combat that secured
their retreat ¹¹⁸. But even a complete victory would have been of
little moment, as the approach of the autumnal equinox summoned
them to hasten their return. To navigate the Euxine before the
month of May, or after that of September, is esteemed by the mo-
dern Turks the most unquestionable instance of rassmess and folly ¹⁷⁹.

XVhen we are informed that the third ficet, equipped by the Goths
in the ports of Bosphorus, confisted of five hundred sail of ships ¹²⁰,

¹¹⁴ He besieged the place with 400 gnllies, ¹¹⁸ Syncellus tells an unintelligible storyof
¹50³000 foot, and a numerous cavalry. See Prince odenathus, who defeated the Goths,
Plutarch in Lucul. Appian in Mithridat. and who was killed by Prince Odmathm.
