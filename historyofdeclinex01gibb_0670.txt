THE DECLINE AND FALL

-stinguissted by their extraffion, which was more truly noble than

that of the greatest monarchs. These were the grandsons of St. Jude
the apostle, who himself was the brother of Jesus Christ ⁴²³. Their
natural pretensions to the throne of David, might perhaps attract
the respe& of the people, and excite thejealousy of the governor ; but
the meanness of ‘their ‘garb, and the simplicity of their answers,
soon convinced him that they were neither defirous nor capable of
disturbing the peace of the Roman empire. They frankly confeffed
their royal origin, and their near relation to the Messiah3 but they
diseliimed any temporal views‚ and professed that his kingdom,
which they devoutly expedstd, was purely of a spiritual and angelic
nature. When they were examined concerning their fortune and
occupatiori, they shewed their hands hardened with daily labour,
and declared that they derived their whole subsistence from the culti-
vation of a farm near the village of Cocaba, of the extent of about
twenty-four English acres⁴⁹, and of the valne of nine thousand
drachms‚ or three hundred pounds sterling. The grandsons of St.
Jude were dismissed with compaffion and contempt ⁵⁰.

But although the obscurity of the house of David might prote&

own family alarrned the pufillanimous temper of Domitian, which

could only be appeased by the blood of those Romans whom he

in the most obvious sense, and it was sup-
posed, that the brothers of Jesus were the law-
sul imre of Joseph and of Mai-y. A devout re-
speft sor the virginity of the mother of God,
suggestsd to the Gnoffics, and afterwards to the
orthodox Greeks, the expedient of bestowing
a second wife on Joseph. The Latius (from
the time of Jerome) improved on that him,
asserted the perpetual celibacy of joseph, and
justified by many similar examples the new in-
terpretation that Jude, as well as Simon and
james, who are style-d the brothers of Jesus

Christ, were only his first cousins. See Til-

⁴⁹ Thirty-nine wop, squares of an hun-
dred feet each, which if strtffly computed
would scarcely amount to nine acres. But the
probability of circumstances, the prastice of
other Greek writers, and the authority of
M. de Valois, incline me to believe that the
mes-pn is used to express the Roman jugerum.
